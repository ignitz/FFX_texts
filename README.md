# Final Fantasy X texts

A decade ago (2007-2010) I tried to translate the game Final Fantasy X to portuguese-br, made the tools to extracted and insert the text. Then few years later [Gledson999 and his team](http://www.retro-jogos.com/2015/09/ps2-final-fantasy-x-international.html) took the project and finished the translation with perfection.

This repository have the original text to playground with vectorize word embedding, machine learning with the texts.
