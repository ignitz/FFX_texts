A sunken city!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
A machina city--<NL>
a thousand years old!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
They built the city on top<NL>
of bridges across the river.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
But the weight of the city<NL>
caused the bridges to collapse,<NL>
and it all sank to the bottom.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Right. It's a good lesson.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
A lesson?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yeah.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why build a city over a river, ya?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh... Well, it would be convenient,<NL>
with all that water there.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Nope, that's not why.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
They just wanted to prove they<NL>
could defy the laws of nature!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hmmm?<NL>
I'm not so sure about that.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Yevon2] has taught us:<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
When humans have power,<NL>
they seek to use it.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
If you don't stop them,<NL>
they go too far, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Yuna], we'll save you!<END>
