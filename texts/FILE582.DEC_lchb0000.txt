<NL>
The hymn we all sang at the stadium<NL>
is still echoing in my ears.<END>

<NL>
The people of Luca will always<NL>
stand behind a blitzer--<NL>
even one condemned as a traitor.<END>

<NL>
The stadium is now open.<NL>
You may enter freely.<END>

<NL>
The first match has already begun.<NL>
Please hurry to your seat.<END>

<NL>
We are currently assessing the damage<NL>
from the fiends. No admittance.<END>

<NL>
Access is no longer restricted.<NL>
Feel free to enter.<END>

<NL>
I wonder who the next grand maester will be...<NL>
I need to book someone for next year's<NL>
opening speech.<END>

<NL>
Most of the warrior monks have withdrawn to<NL>
Bevelle, but some have taken a liking to Luca<NL>
and remained here.<END>

<NL>
Even now that the tournament's over,<NL>
the stadium is always jam-packed.<NL>
That's Luca for you.<END>

<NL>
I'm right by the stadium, but I can't<NL>
watch the game. What a bummer...<END>

<NL>
Did you forget something inside?<NL>
Give it up. I doubt you'll find it.<END>

<NL>
It took forever to fix the<NL>
stands inside the stadium.<END>

<NL>
The stadium is surrounded by numerous<NL>
ports laid out in a circular fashion.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
So it's impossible to get lost.<NL>
Turn here to get to <Cor 88>dock number <VAR12 30><Cor 41>.<END>

<NL>
Even through all the hardship, the people of Luca<NL>
enjoy blitzball and carry on with their lives.<NL>
Oh, how I admire their strength.<END>

<NL>
We are protecting Luca under Maester Kinoc's<NL>
orders. You should all be grateful!<END>

<NL>
I hope the operation succeeds.<NL>
I want to come back here next year...<END>

<NL>
Once the tournament is over, the<NL>
operation will commence. Better<NL>
enjoy blitzball while I still can.<END>

<NL>
The merchants of Luca have raised<NL>
money to support the Crusaders.<END>

<NL>
So many Crusaders have died and yet people<NL>
are watching blitzball? This city is heartless.<END>

<NL>
I am relieved the grand maester is safe.<NL>
We owe it all to [Master Seymor].<END>

<NL>
The Crusaders were in charge of guarding<NL>
the stadium up until last year.<END>

<NL>
But they're all busy preparing for<NL>
the operation now. So this year, the<NL>
citizens have taken up security posts.<END>

<NL>
I heard Sin has fallen in Bevelle!<NL>
Could it be that the Calm is almost here?<END>

<NL>
I've decided to join the Crusaders.<NL>
No sense hiding behind their back all the time.<END>

<NL>
Looks like that last machina attack sent<NL>
Sin back to sea for now. Let's hope we<NL>
get some peace and quiet for awhile.<END>

<NL>
Ending the tournament with the fiend<NL>
attack left a bad taste in my mouth.<END>

<NL>
The Goers are definitely gonna win.<NL>
Everyone else is goin' down!<END>

<NL>
The Crusaders will help us with security.<NL>
We will support them all the way!<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks are helping us out,<NL>
so guard duty's not as bad as before.<END>

<NL>
Please report any suspicious activity.<END>

<NL>
I hope the Calm will last at least a year.<NL>
Would three be asking for too much?<END>

<NL>
I think the Crusaders are more suited<NL>
to Luca than the warrior monks are.<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks are planning to guard the<NL>
ferries. I'm not sure if that's good or bad.<END>

<NL>
[Maester Mika2] returned to [Bevelle]<NL>
soon after the tournament.<END>

<NL>
Tickets were so hard to come by this year.<NL>
Oh, well... Guess I'll watch the game over<NL>
at the cafe.<END>

<NL>
Once Sin is gone for good, I hope you play<NL>
every day! I'll be there to cheer you on!<END>

<NL>
Hey, when are you playin' next?<NL>
I really want to see you again.<END>

<NL>
I really enjoyed your awesome moves!<NL>
I hope I get to see you play more often.<END>

<NL>
Nice work out there.<NL>
Now I know you're not all talk.<END>

<NL>
I saw your rallying cry on the sphere.<NL>
Heheh, best of luck to you.<END>

<NL>
Did you know that you're more popular than<NL>
ever, now that you're branded as a traitor?<END>

<NL>
No one knows who unleashed the<NL>
fiends into the stadium.<END>

<NL>
I'm afraid to imagine what would've<NL>
happened if [Master Seymor] hadn't been here.<END>

<NL>
Players must return to their locker<NL>
room for the opening ceremony.<END>

<NL>
I will fight as a Crusader until<NL>
Spira is rid of all fiends.<END>

<NL>
I quit the Crusaders after the operation,<NL>
but I'm back in again. I think I have Crusader<NL>
blood running through my veins.<END>

<NL>
The captain's making me work<NL>
so that he can go see the game!<END>

<NL>
I will be heading for the operation soon.<NL>
I must bid adieu to the city of [Luca].<END>

<NL>
I'm rooting for the Al Bhed Psyches this year.<NL>
They're helping out the Crusaders, you know.<END>

<NL>
The flying ship at dock 1<NL>
is the legendary airship!<NL>
So the tales are true!<END>

<NL>
We have resumed ferry operation.<NL>
We're as busy as ever.<END>

<NL>
Sin is lurking in the waters nearby.<NL>
Ferry service has been postponed indefinitely.<END>

<NL>
Even the ships don't leave the port during<NL>
the tournament. Just kick back and relax, man.<END>

<NL>
Once the Crusaders regroup in Luca, they<NL>
will charge through the Mi'ihen Highroad<NL>
and lay waste to all the fiends!<END>

<NL>
Please report any suspicious<NL>
activity to me immediately!<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s have planned a grand<NL>
operation to smash the fiends.<END>

<NL>
I should be reporting to the base by now,<NL>
but I just want to catch one glimpse of the<NL>
opening ceremony.<END>

<NL>
Once the Calm arrives, we must have a<NL>
commemorative tournament! Actually,<NL>
we're already in the planning stages.<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks have left, but the<NL>
Crusaders have returned to serve as guards.<NL>
A blessing from Yevon indeed!<END>

<NL>
The temple has dispatched their warrior monks<NL>
to guard the stadium. I am thankful, indeed.<END>

<NL>
We were supposed to get some time off after<NL>
the tournament, but with the sudden fiend<NL>
incident and all, we're busy with the investigation.<END>

<NL>
Aren't you a blitzer?<NL>
Better check the rules while you still can.<END>

<NL>
The opening ceremony is about to begin.<NL>
All players must wait in their locker rooms.<END>

<NL>
You're not a blitzer, are you?<NL>
Nah, couldn't be. The game's already started.<END>

<NL>
We're still investigating how<NL>
the fiends managed to get in.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm sorry, but please wait for an<NL>
official statement regarding this matter.<END>
