Wow! Your face is beet red!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You okay?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
He...he asked me to marry him!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You serious?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
You know what [Yuna] must do.<END>

<TEXT>
[Seymor]<NL>
<TEXT>
Of course.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Lady [Yuna]--no, all summoners--are<NL>
charged with bringing peace to [Spira].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
But this means more<NL>
than just defeating [Sin].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
She must ease the<NL>
suffering of all [Spira].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
She must be a leader for the people.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I proposed to Lady [Yuna]<NL>
as a maester of [Yevon2].<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Spira] is no playhouse.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
A moment's diversion may amuse an<NL>
audience, but it changes nothing.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Even so, the actors<NL>
must play their parts.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
There's no need to answer right away.<NL>
Please, think it over.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
We will do so, then.<END>

<TEXT>
[Auron]<NL>
<TEXT>
We leave.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Lady [Yuna],<NL>
I await your favorable reply.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Why are you still here, sir?<END>

<TEXT>
[Seymor]<NL>
<TEXT>
I beg your pardon.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
We [Guado] are keen<NL>
to the scent of the [Farplane].<END>
