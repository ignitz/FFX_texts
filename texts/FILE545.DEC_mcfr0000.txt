[Auron]<NL>
You're worried about [Yuna].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
'Course I'm worried about her.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What is she thinking?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
The simplest answer would be...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
in exchange for<NL>
agreeing to marry him...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
she hopes to negotiate<NL>
with [Seymor].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Negotiate what?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I wonder.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What? All by herself?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
She's strong, but [Seymor]<NL>
is the better negotiator.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well then, why don't we<NL>
do something about it?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Yuna] wants it this way.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Argh!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I just don't get it!<NL>
Doesn't she trust us?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
On the contrary...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
She doesn't want us caught up<NL>
in whatever it is she's planning.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, that's what I thought.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But that makes me worry even more.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
She could just tell us.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
That's the way she is.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
She's naive, serious to a fault,<NL>
and doesn't ask for help.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You're probably right.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Yuna]'s easy to read.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, she is.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
But hard to guard.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Stand by her, always.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Slowpokes!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sorry!<END>

<NL>
It's funny how calm I was.<END>

<NL>
Maybe it was because I'd realized that<NL>
[Yuna] wasn't marrying [Seymor] for love.<NL>
Not really.<END>

<NL>
It was just her duty--something she had<NL>
to do before returning to her pilgrimage.<END>

<NL>
That's what I kept<NL>
telling myself, anyway.<END>

<NL>
And well, maybe...<END>

<NL>
I realized that [Yuna] and<NL>
I'd never... You know...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna], let's go.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Lady [Yuna], it is good to see<NL>
you made it through safely.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
And, if I may,<NL>
congratulations on your betrothal.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Maester [Seymor]'s<NL>
people are expecting you.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Take that road<NL>
to go to <Cor 88>[Macalania Temple]<Cor 41>.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
This road leads to [Bevelle].<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
You should hurry to the temple in Macalania.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
This isn't the way to the temple!<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Weren't you listening<NL>
to Captain [Lucil]?<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
We've received several reports of<NL>
summoners disappearing<NL>
these last few days.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Please be careful, my lady.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
When our assignment here is done<NL>
we will be heading north.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Hopefully we'll catch some<NL>
chocobos and rebuild our unit.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
But I must say...<NL>
it's been a while.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Maybe too long since<NL>
we've had anything to celebrate.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
We're on watch duty at the temple<NL>
at least until the wedding's done.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Anyone tries to crash our party,<NL>
we'll send 'em packing!<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Oh, yeah, [Clasko]'s back there<NL>
with the chocobo.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Stop and say hi<NL>
if you've got the time.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Next time you see us, we'll be the<NL>
proud Chocobo Knights once again!<END>

<NL>
Hm? What do you want?<END>

<NL>
I'm waiting for my dad!<END>

<NL>
It's too dangerous to walk to<NL>
<Cor 88>[Macalania Temple]<Cor 41> without my dad.<END>

<NL>
Are you a guardian?<NL>
Keep up the good work.<END>

<NL>
I'd like to go to <Cor 88>[Macalania Temple]<Cor 41><NL>
with my son, but with so many fiends here,<NL>
I'd feel better with my husband along.<END>

<NL>
I guess you could say<NL>
he is like my guardian.<END>

<NL>
Maester [Seymor] awaits.<NL>
Please hurry to <Cor 88>[Macalania Temple]<Cor 41>.<END>

<NL>
I leave Lady [Yuna] in your hands<NL>
until you are through these woods.<END>

<NL>
I'm supposed to meet my dad<NL>
here, but he's late!<END>

<NL>
Oh, no. Maybe he forgot<NL>
where we're supposed to meet...<END>

<NL>
My dad forgets a lot of things.<END>

<NL>
I'm supposed to meet my husband here,<NL>
but he hasn't shown up for the longest time.<END>

<NL>
I hope nothing bad has happened.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
He's so forgetful. Maybe he's just<NL>
forgotten our meeting place.<END>

<NL>
I was reunited with my wife<NL>
thanks to all of you.<END>

<NL>
But now my boy's missing.<NL>
He went into the woods alone.<END>

<NL>
I guess he went looking for me<NL>
since I was late. I'd better find<NL>
him before the fiends do.<END>

<NL>
I finally met up with my<NL>
husband, thanks to your help.<NL>
I can't thank you enough.<END>

<NL>
But my son went off into the<NL>
woods before my husband came.<END>

<NL>
I...I don't know what to do.<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
[O'aka]'s, open for business!<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
Welcome! We've got<NL>
some goodies today!<END>
