[Gatta]<NL>
Why only you, sir?<NL>
I want to fight, too!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Orders are orders.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
I'm not a cadet anymore, sir!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Let me go with you, and<NL>
I'll prove it to them!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Guarding the command center<NL>
is important too, you know.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
But I came all the way from<NL>
[Besaid] to fight [Sin], sir!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I know, but an order's an order.<NL>
To your post, Crusader.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
But, sir!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
They let you through, huh?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Gatta] deserves better...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
At least there's no<NL>
chance he'll get hurt.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why are you guys fighting, anyway? Aren't<NL>
the almighty [Al Bhed] machina enough?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
They still need some<NL>
time to get them ready.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Our job is to keep [Sin]<NL>
at bay till they're done.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
[Wakka]...<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I might not get another<NL>
chance to say this.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
It's about your brother.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Luzzu], no!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I'm the one who<NL>
convinced him...to enlist.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
When we used to play blitz together,<NL>
[Chappu] used to say...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He'd say that--when we won the<NL>
Cup, ya?--he'd propose to [Lulu].<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
And then one day...he goes off and<NL>
becomes a [Crusader]. Just like that.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
[Chappu] also said to me...<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
That being with your girl is good...<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
But keeping [Sin] far<NL>
away from her is better.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Lu, you knew?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Luzzu] told me...before we left.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
She hit me, too.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
All [Crusader]s in the vanguard<NL>
are to assemble on the beach!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
That's my cue.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Luzzu]!<NL>
Don't die out there.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
So you can hit me more?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Lots! Lots more!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sir [Luzzu], please!<NL>
Please, don't go!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I have to, [Yuna].<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Let him go.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
The man has already<NL>
chosen his path...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
As you did when you<NL>
became a summoner.<END>

<NL>
It would be a long time...<END>

<NL>
before I ever really understood the<NL>
reason why [Yuna] let [Luzzu] pass that day.<END>

<NL>
Be sure to make thorough preparations.<NL>
Here, put this to good use.<END>

<NL>
Give this to the lady summoner, and<NL>
grant us your help when the time comes.<END>

<NL>
We've secured the command center perimeter.<NL>
But please take this as a precaution.<END>

<NL>
We've concentrated our forces along the<NL>
coast to prevent [Sin] from reaching land.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We plan to stage a frontal assault.<NL>
The men are preparing for the worst.<END>

<NL>
My friend is stationed there.<NL>
All I can do is pray for him.<END>

<NL>
The command center is strategically<NL>
located on a ledge overlooking the sea.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's just beyond the artillery base up ahead.<END>

<NL>
We have neutralized all fiends around<NL>
the command center.  The sector is secure.<END>

<NL>
This is a mechanical lift<NL>
built by the [Al Bhed2].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Please take it up<NL>
to the command center.<END>

<NL>
Relying on machines goes against the<NL>
teachings, but the maester just used it.<END>

<NL>
You're out of luck.<NL>
It's not workin' anymore.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Stop relyin' on machina.<NL>
Use your feet a little.<END>

<NL>
This machina's had it.<NL>
Completely busted.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I will try salvaging its parts.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
The sea breeze really rusted away<NL>
this baby. No point repairing it.<NL>
It probably won't work anyway.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Wakka]!<NL>
That's enough, [Wakka]!<END>
