[Tidus]<NL>
Check it out!<END>

<NL>
That sunset was different from<NL>
the one I saw in Kilika.<NL>
It was quiet--almost gentle.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whatcha up to?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Pretty...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sure is.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I wish I could live<NL>
in a place like this.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Peaceful... Living with a smile<NL>
on my face every day.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You can, once<NL>
you beat [Sin], right?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But then a new [Sin]<NL>
will be born anyway.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well then, you can<NL>
just beat it again.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I wish I could.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, you can! Trust me!<NL>
You are the best summoner out there!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna], why does [Sin]<NL>
always come back?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Sin] is our punishment<NL>
for our vanity.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And it will not go away<NL>
until we've atoned.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How do we do that?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What did we do that was<NL>
so bad in the first place?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Was it using lots of machina<NL>
or something? Oh... Wait, was<NL>
that such a bad thing, really?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's funny...<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Ever since I was young,<NL>
I never questioned it.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But now that you ask me if it<NL>
is that bad or not...I don't know.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
There are so many<NL>
things I don't know.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well then, we're the same!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Such thinking is very<NL>
unbecoming of a summoner!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sound like [Mika]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
That's not very nice, you know!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You know...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
During a game, you have to think<NL>
of blitz and nothing else, you know?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Okay.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You can't think, "That's a cute girl<NL>
in the fifth seat from the right."<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And you can't be thinking about<NL>
where you're going to go on that<NL>
date, because the minute you do,<NL>
that's when you lose!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You see, uh, [Yuna], what I mean is,<NL>
you really shouldn't worry, you know?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
After we beat [Sin], that's when<NL>
you can worry about the future.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I guess.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But, [Yuna], how are you supposed<NL>
to beat something big like that?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The Final Summoning.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's the only way to defeat Sin.<NL>
The only way.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
With it, we can call the Final Aeon.<NL>
That's the goal of the pilgrimage.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The Fayth of the Final Summoning lies<NL>
waiting in the far north, to greet<NL>
summoners that complete their pilgrimage.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
At the world's edge...<NL>
in [Zanarkand].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
In [Zanarkand]?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
She means the ruins of a city<NL>
destroyed a thousand years ago.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You sure it's ruins?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
That's what I've heard.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
You'll see it for<NL>
yourself soon enough.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Yuna], come back inside.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You will go with us...<NL>
to [Zanarkand]?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, I'll go.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'll go to [Zanarkand] to<NL>
see it with my own eyes.<END>

<NL>
I knew it couldn't be my [Zanarkand].<NL>
But I had to make sure.<END>
