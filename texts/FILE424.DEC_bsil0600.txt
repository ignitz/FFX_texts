[Wakka]<NL>
This is where I was born.<NL>
I started blitz when I was five.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I joined the [Aurochs]<NL>
at thirteen...ten years ago.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Ten years...and we never won a game.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Well, after last year's tournament,<NL>
I quit. Time seemed right.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It's an ancient custom.<NL>
People leaving the island<NL>
pray here for a safe trip.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
They say it works pretty good.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Take your time.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's get going, man!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We're gonna wait.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Are you ready?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's going on?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Chappu] didn't pray that day.<NL>
Said he'd miss his boat.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
That should do it!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
This isn't the way to the pier.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What are you up to out here?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Watching for fiends!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
We [Crusader]s must protect the village.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Even if we cannot defeat [Sin],<NL>
we do what we can.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Leave [Sin] to us.<NL>
We'll think of something.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Then you should pray before you go.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
All who leave the island pray<NL>
for safe passage over there.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
[Gatta] always refused, though.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well then, I will too.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Who needs hokey old superstitions?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I won't pray, and I'll<NL>
beat [Sin] all the same!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Well, I guess you have the spirit.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Good luck.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Even should the temple<NL>
forsake us, we will do our duty.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
We are the shield that guards this land.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I can't believe they're<NL>
calling Lady [Yuna] a traitor.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Calling Lady [Yuna] a traitor...<NL>
there must be some mistake.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Everyone in [Besaid] thinks so.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
As long as [Sin] remains,<NL>
so does our duty.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
They say a flying ship<NL>
gave [Sin] a good chase.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Never let your guard down!<NL>
[Sin] is the most evil of foes.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
All we can do is pray that this<NL>
ship of the skies can defeat [Sin].<END>
