<NL>
Slaying Sin should<NL>
calm Spira's seas.<END>

<NL>
I shouldn't say this out loud, but<NL>
the temples are way outta line!<NL>
Dang it, I said it out loud...<END>

<NL>
Every time I hear about a wedding,<NL>
I start thinking, perhaps I should settle<NL>
down. But I never go through with it.<END>

<NL>
You think you can have just one more drink.<NL>
Just one more. But as long as you<NL>
think that way, you can never quit.<END>

<NL>
I couldn't get any tickets, so I was<NL>
watching the game on that sphere.<END>

<NL>
I was lucky to miss the fiends.<END>

<NL>
I was lucky. That's all I can say.<NL>
Praise be to [Yevon2]!<END>

<NL>
I'd like to recruit as many as<NL>
possible and rebuild the [Crusader]s.<END>

<NL>
It may actually be nice to<NL>
quit the [Crusader]s and join<NL>
the warrior monks.<END>

<NL>
[Spira] is full of fiends.<NL>
Who knows when or where they'll strike?<END>

<NL>
Never expected that the [Crusader]s<NL>
would try to recruit me. Not in a<NL>
million years.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s and warrior monks<NL>
share a common desire to protect<NL>
the people.<END>

<NL>
So, basically, you don't<NL>
know anything, huh?<END>

<NL>
It's almost time for the [Calm].<NL>
I'm sure that [Maester Mika] is<NL>
smiling from the Farplane.<END>

<NL>
The high summoner's daughter would never<NL>
turn traitor. The temple must be mistaken.<END>

<NL>
Maester [Seymor] is getting married?<NL>
Aww, what a shame.<END>

<NL>
There are warrior monks everywhere<NL>
you look. I think it's an occupation!<END>

<NL>
[Seymor]'s aeon was really something,<NL>
wasn't it? I've never seen anything like it!<END>

<NL>
I'd like to believe that a maester of<NL>
such power could keep [Spira] peaceful.<END>

<NL>
When the flying ship came by,<NL>
we raised our glasses and sang.<END>

<NL>
Is Lady [Yuna] a traitor or not?<NL>
With everyone gabbing, I don't<NL>
know what to believe.<END>

<NL>
The wedding of Maester [Seymor]<NL>
and Lady [Yuna] will be extravagant.<NL>
I'm sure it will go down in history.<END>

<NL>
It may take awhile for the<NL>
[Crusader]s to recover. I wonder<NL>
what they're going to do now.<END>

<NL>
Hey, you're an [Aurochs] player,<NL>
aren't you? You were great today!<END>

<NL>
You ended a twenty-three-year losing streak.<NL>
I never thought it would happen. What a miracle!<END>

<NL>
Even though you didn't win, it was<NL>
a good game. Keep up the good work.<END>

<NL>
If Sin is really defeated, we<NL>
should hold a tournament<NL>
to herald the new Calm.<END>

<NL>
We should hold a [blitzball] tournament<NL>
to aid Yevon in this time of crisis.<END>

<NL>
We should have a [blitzball]<NL>
tournament in celebration of<NL>
Maester [Seymor]'s marriage.<END>

<NL>
So shall we start a [blitzball] tournament<NL>
to console the defeated [Crusader]s?<END>

<NL>
The tournament's finally over.<NL>
Gimme some peace, will you?<END>

<NL>
It's terrible. The fiends attacked<NL>
while His Holiness was here.<END>

<NL>
The tournament committee wasn't<NL>
pleased when the captain of the<NL>
guard lost his nerve and ran.<END>

<NL>
I've got some news for you! They<NL>
say that Lord [Braska]'s daughter<NL>
is on that flying ship!<END>

<NL>
I heard that the [Guado] razed the<NL>
[Al Bhed]'s hometown. That's horrible! <END>

<NL>
I think the Maester's wedding<NL>
should be held at Luca Stadium.<NL>
It'll be more festive there, no?<END>

<NL>
Seems that summoners are<NL>
disappearing from all over Spira, huh?<END>

<NL>
It was so cool when the flying<NL>
ship came by. Everyone was singing<NL>
and drinking. It was wild!<END>

<NL>
The temple's in chaos? Really?<NL>
That's too bad, but we've got other<NL>
problems to worry about, like [blitzball].<END>

<NL>
I wonder if anyone will quit<NL>
the [Crusader]s and help out<NL>
with the stadium repairs.<END>

<NL>
I heard the operation failed.<NL>
I guess machina weapons just<NL>
don't do the trick.<END>

<NL>
We have to repair the stadium<NL>
now because of the fiends.<END>

I can say that I'm honored to<NL>
hand over the family heirloom.<END>

<NL>
Our ancestors received this<NL>
artifact from Lord [High Summoner Ohalland].<NL>
Please use it with care!<END>

<NL>
Hello! Blitzball players<NL>
are welcome here any time!<END>

<NL>
Doesn't matter if you can't play.<NL>
After all, a player is a player!<NL>
Good luck. I'm with you all the way!<END>

<NL>
The temple is a wreck.<NL>
I really want to quit the warrior monks.<END>

<NL>
Then join the [Crusader]s!<NL>
We'd love to have you join our force.<END>

<NL>
With [Operation Mi'ihen] a failure,<NL>
it's over for the [Crusader]s...<END>

<NL>
Then do you wanna become a warrior monk?<NL>
I'll introduce you to our leader.<END>

<NL>
What? We disobeyed the<NL>
teachings, but it's still okay?<END>

<NL>
Hey, we all help each other<NL>
out in a time of need, right?<END>

<NL>
The fiends were the [Al Bhed]'s doing!<NL>
They're out to get the temples!<END>

<NL>
What're you saying?<NL>
You know the [Al Bhed] use machina!<END>

<NL>
Yeah, I guess you're right.<END>

<NL>
The fiends were the [Crusader]s' doing!<NL>
They're out to sabotage the tournament!<END>

<NL>
You're making no sense at all.<NL>
And you aren't the least<NL>
bit convincing, either.<END>

<NL>
Yeah, I agree.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Auron]'s not here.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Let's ask around!<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
Why not talk, [Kimahri]?<NL>
Not see [Yenke] for ten years!<NL>
Say something!<END>

[Yenke]<NL>
[Kimahri] forget [Yenke]?<NL>
Forget [Biran]?<END>

[Biran]<NL>
Leave [Kimahri], [Yenke].<NL>
[Kimahri] is small [Ronso].<END>

[Biran]<NL>
[Kimahri] so small can't see<NL>
[Yenke] and [Biran]'s faces.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yenke]<NL>
[Kimahri] forget [Ronso] friends?<NL>
We taught you much<NL>
at time of horn-molt!<END>

[Yenke]<NL>
[Biran] taught [Kimahri]<NL>
to be strong [Ronso].<END>

[Biran]<NL>
Maybe taught too much.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Take 'em on!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
Take it outside!<NL>
The tournament's starting, you hear?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The game!<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Today, on this glorious day,<NL>
players from all over<NL>
[Spira] have assembled here...<END>

[Mika]<NL>
to participate in this great contest<NL>
of bravery, skill, and strength.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Kimahri]! [Yuna]'s gone!<END>

<NL>
You're a good player,<NL>
but still need some work.<END>

<NL>
If you want to get your hands on that<NL>
thing, you'll have to win more games.<END>

<NL>
Wow, you've become a great player!<END>

<NL>
Now, as long as you bring it to me,<NL>
I'll present you with our heirloom.<END>

<NL>
Hey there, star player!<END>

<NL>
Hey, you have it, right?<NL>
Lemme see it for a second.<END>

<NL>
Yeah, yeah, that's it!<NL>
Hmm...but it still doesn't<NL>
have enough power.<END>

<NL>
Aw, too bad! If it had enough,<NL>
I would've given you our heirloom.<END>

<NL>
This is the legendary ball<NL>
of Lord [High Summoner Ohalland].<END>

<NL>
We have treasured it for generations.<END>

<NL>
I beg of you, carry on the spirit<NL>
of Lord [High Summoner Ohalland].<END>
