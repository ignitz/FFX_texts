[Tidus]<NL>
Nice excuse.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hey, hey!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
So, after quitting,<NL>
I got this new job, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But every time my mind wandered,<NL>
I thought about the game.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Ten years without<NL>
a single win'll do that.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
My first match last year<NL>
was my big chance.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But something else was on my mind.<NL>
I couldn't focus.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So you want to win the next<NL>
tournament--go out with a bang.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, what's our goal?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I don't care how we do.<NL>
Long as we play our best.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No, no, no, no, no.<NL>
If I say, "What's our goal?"<NL>
you say, "Victory!"<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
When you play in a [blitzball]<NL>
tournament, you play to win!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Victory? You serious?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
If we give it our all,<NL>
I can walk away happy.<END>

<NL>
Ah, the one from the sea!<END>

<NL>
Be on guard. There're<NL>
fiends on the road today!<END>

<NL>
After surviving your run-in with [Sin],<NL>
'twould be a shame if something happened now.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Who were they?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Luzzu] and [Gatta]--[Crusader]s.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Crews of what?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What, you forgot that, too?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hey, sorry.<NL>
Don't worry about it, I'll help you out.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Cool.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
In return, come tournament time,<NL>
I'll make sure we take the cup!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Cool.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
About the [Crusader]s, you can<NL>
ask them yourself. They've got<NL>
a lodge in the village.<END>
