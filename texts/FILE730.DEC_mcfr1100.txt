<NL>
We escaped with our skins intact,<NL>
but [Yuna] lost something.<END>

<NL>
I could already tell, her faith was<NL>
shaken. [Yevon2] had betrayed her.<END>

<NL>
I felt like I should do<NL>
or say something--anything...<END>

<NL>
But nothing came.<NL>
I was just as lost as she was.<NL>
And then...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Well?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
We're all clear.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
We will have to avoid<NL>
[Bevelle] in the future.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Yuna]?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Said she wanted to be alone.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Of course.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Maybe you should talk to her?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I am...tired.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Must be tough for [Yuna].<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We leave at daybreak.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
If [Yuna] figures out<NL>
where we're going, that is.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I feel kinda bad leaving<NL>
everything up to her, you know?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna]'s off in the woods.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Kimahri]'s with her, but<NL>
maybe you should go, too?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I think it might help<NL>
if you were there.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Lulu]<NL>
It would be so easy to fight<NL>
without thinking...<NL>
Walk a straight line. So easy.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Wonder what [Yunie]'ll do, huh?<NL>
Think she'll quit her pilgrimage?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
That's what you want, right?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Well...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
If [Yunie] really wants<NL>
to keep going, then...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I guess I shouldn't<NL>
stop her, you know?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
That's what I think, anyway.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I wonder if there's a way to perform<NL>
the Final Summoning and not die?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
That'd be great, wouldn't it?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I guess someone would've thought<NL>
of it in the last thousand years, huh?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Hey, maybe you should<NL>
go talk to [Yunie].<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sir [Auron]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Wakka]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Lulu]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Kimahri]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Rikku]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Everyone, we leave at dawn.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm sorry for putting<NL>
you through all this.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And...um...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Enough. You need your rest.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Good night.<END>
