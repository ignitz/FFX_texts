[Lulu]<NL>
He does look a lot like [Chappu].<NL>
I was surprised, too,<NL>
the first time I saw him.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
But no matter what he<NL>
looks like, he isn't [Chappu].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You shouldn't have brought<NL>
him here in the first place!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yeah, but...he needed our help!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Excuses again?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yeah, but... <END>

[Lulu]<NL>
That's it. No more.<NL>
Enough, [Wakka]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I hate you!<END>

<NL>
He's dead, okay? Dead!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Scary!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, who's [Chappu]?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
My little brother, [Chappu].<NL>
He looked like you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
He's dead?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He was with the [Crusader]s when they<NL>
fought [Sin] last year. He didn't make it.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I first heard on the<NL>
day of the tournament.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, so that's why.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I became a guardian<NL>
to fight [Sin], ya?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Revenge, then?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
That was the idea.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I'm more worried about a stupid<NL>
game now than avenging my brother.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Well, after the next tournament,<NL>
I'll be a guardian full-time.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I know it kinda looks like<NL>
I'm using you, but I'm not.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Don't worry.<NL>
I mean, I owe you a lot.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You really helped me out, you know?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What I mean is...<NL>
thanks, [Wakka].<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Stop, you're embarrassing me!<END>
