<NL>
I beg your pardon,<NL>
but may I ask your name?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I am Summoner [Yuna],<NL>
from the isle of [Besaid].<END>

<NL>
As I thought!<END>

<NL>
The daughter of Lord [Braska].<NL>
You have the look of your father.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
My father?<NL>
You knew him?<END>

<NL>
No, I have never met the man.<END>

<NL>
Ah, my apologies.<NL>
I am [Isaaru].<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
I am a summoner, like you.<END>

<NL>
I'm [Pacce].<NL>
Pleased to meet you.<END>

<NL>
And I'm [Maroda].<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
I'm guarding my big brother here.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
Since I was a child, I've always<NL>
looked up to Lord [Braska].<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
I wished I would someday become<NL>
a high summoner like he was.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
You must have some of your<NL>
father's talent in you!<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
I believe you might<NL>
someday defeat [Sin].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I...I'm not really...<NL>
I've only just become a summoner.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
Of course, I've no intention<NL>
of losing, either.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
So perhaps we should race to see<NL>
who can defeat [Sin] first, no?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Very well, then.<NL>
I accept your challenge.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
[Isaaru]!<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
[Yuna], I beg your leave.<NL>
Good luck, to both of us!<END>

<TEXT>
[Yuna]<NL>
Yes.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
Hey, you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Me?<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
You are [Yuna]'s guardian, no?<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
[Maroda]'s heard a curious rumor.<NL>
I thought you should know.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
I heard it from those [Crusader]s.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Seems that summoners have been going<NL>
out on pilgrimage and just...disappearing.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
It could just be the fiends got them...<NL>
but not so many so quickly.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Sorry I don't know more,<NL>
but...watch your back.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Ain't much future for a guardian<NL>
without a summoner, eh?<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
What? What?<NL>
Whatcha all talkin' 'bout?<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
We're talking about doing<NL>
your job as a guardian!<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
Hey, I'm doing good!<NL>
Right, big brother?<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
Please, be careful.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Will do!<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
[Pacce]!<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
Oh... What?<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
We're leaving!<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
Be right there!<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
See ya!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
So you're a champion of<NL>
[Yevon2] now, [Braska]?<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
We summoners must do our part, before<NL>
another fool plan wastes more lives.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
I hear [Operation Mi'ihen]<NL>
did not go well...<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
Now, we go to [Kilika].<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
From there we take the ferry,<NL>
perhaps as far as [Besaid].<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
I keep telling 'im, the more time<NL>
we waste, the farther we'll fall behind<NL>
the other summoners.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Our itinerary just keeps slipping.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
We should be climbing the slopes<NL>
of [Mt. Gagazet] by now.<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
It's so pretty...<END>

<NL>
The Cloister of Trials lies within.<NL>
Are you prepared?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Yes.<NL>
<CHOICE2>No.<END>

<NL>
The fayth has retired for the evening.<NL>
The Cloister of Trials has been sealed.<END>

<NL>
The path to the Trials has been sealed.<NL>
Please proceed to the next temple.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
You're leaving, I hear.<NL>
Farewell, I hope we meet again.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I suppose this is farewell, then.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I'm leaving...back to [Besaid].<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I can't stay here eating<NL>
the temple's bread forever.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I'm one of the only [Crusader]s still here.<END>

<NL>
Once, travellers of the Highroad would<NL>
customarily stop over at this temple<NL>
and pray for a safe journey.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Nowadays, they just pass by<NL>
without stopping.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
How dare they neglect the precepts that have<NL>
sustained [Spira] for a thousand years?<END>

<NL>
We must lead errant souls<NL>
back to the way; otherwise,<NL>
[Yevon2]'s teachings will perish.<END>

<NL>
Is Maester [Seymor] really getting married?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
A [Guado] maester marrying a daughter<NL>
of a high summoner. It's unprecedented.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
I heard you're leaving, too.<NL>
Good luck. I hope we meet again someday.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
I'm going back to [Besaid].<NL>
With [Luzzu] gone...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah. It'd be hard<NL>
fighting alone, wouldn't it?<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Most of the other [Crusader]s<NL>
have already left.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
I'll go soon.<END>
