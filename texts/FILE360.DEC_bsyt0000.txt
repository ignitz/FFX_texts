[Tidus]<NL>
Is something wrong?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
The summoner hasn't<NL>
returned from the trial.<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
<TEXT>
Eh?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Well, apprentice summoner, really...<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
<TEXT>
Ah?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
There's a room in there called<NL>
the Cloister of Trials. Beyond is<NL>
where the apprentice summoner prays.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
If the prayer is heard, the apprentice<NL>
becomes a fully-fledged summoner,<NL>
remember?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So someone is in there somewhere<NL>
and they haven't come back out.<NL>
Right, I got it.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
A day's already gone by.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Is it particularly<NL>
dangerous in there?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Sometimes, yes.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why don't you go in and help?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
There's already guardians in there.<NL>
Besides, it's forbidden.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, but what if somethin' happens?<NL>
What if the summoner dies!?<END>

<NL>
The precepts must be obeyed!<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
<TEXT>
Like I care!<END>

<NL>
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea<NL>
after all.<END>

<NL>
Man, was I surprised.<END>

<NL>
And here I was thinking summoners<NL>
were all old geezers.<END>

<NL>
You're the guy from the sea, right?<NL>
I heard about you from Sir [Luzzu].<END>

<NL>
[High Summoner Gandof], give us your<NL>
blessing, and watch over my family.<END>

<NL>
I'm getting ready to go out fishing.<NL>
There's fiends out in the sea, ya?<END>

<NL>
What are you saying? You would<NL>
break the precepts, fool child?<END>

<NL>
Pray with daddy for<NL>
the summoner, okay?<END>

<NL>
You should pray for the<NL>
apprentice summoner's safety, too.<END>

<NL>
You might think about not<NL>
having that toxin cured.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I know there's lots of things<NL>
I'd like to forget. Lots.<END>

<NL>
You know why the temple faces<NL>
away from the sea?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
So it does not have to look upon<NL>
the sea from which [Sin] comes.<END>

<NL>
I'm heading out fishing, so I'm<NL>
praying for a [Sin]less ocean.<END>

<NL>
I'm getting ready to go out fishing.<NL>
There's fiends out in the sea, ya?<END>

<NL>
The [Aurochs] put up a great fight this year.<NL>
[Wakka]'s the best, ya?<END>

<NL>
It may not be much help to Lady [Yuna],<NL>
but allow me to pray for you.<END>

<NL>
I know [Sin]'s out there, but if I<NL>
don't go out, my family won't eat.<END>

<NL>
I hear you're traitors, now?<NL>
Who's responsible for that nonsense?<END>

<NL>
When will Lady [Yuna]'s<NL>
Calm come to Spira...<END>

<NL>
The temple's so busy chasing<NL>
traitors they've left [Sin] alone.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It will be a long time yet before<NL>
I can feel safe going out to sea.<END>

<NL>
I'll be out to sea soon. Perhaps I'll<NL>
be greeting the Calm from deck.<END>

<NL>
I was pulling in my catch when<NL>
[Sin] and the flying ship went by.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
What a sight!<NL>
I think I forgot to sing.<END>

<NL>
I'm praying for the blessings of [Yevon2]<NL>
to guide that flying ship.<END>

<NL>
Odd clothes you got. What land you from?<NL>
This your first time to [Besaid]?<END>

<NL>
We don't get many strangers here.<NL>
I remember every visitor we get.<END>

<NL>
Everyone's gone to the temple, but<NL>
I'm more comfortable praying at home.<END>

<NL>
And what if something happened?<NL>
I'd be afraid to go see.<END>

<NL>
At last, Lady [Yuna] has become<NL>
a true summoner like her father!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
She was so small when she first<NL>
came to [Besaid].<END>

<NL>
I am sure Lady [Yuna] will become a high<NL>
summoner. Everyone in [Besaid] thinks so.<END>

<NL>
I heard the [Crusader]s' operation failed.<NL>
Maybe [Luzzu] and [Gatta] will repent and come home.<END>

<NL>
I've no desire to go against the<NL>
teachings, but something's not right<NL>
with the temple these days.<END>

<NL>
Daddy doesn't play<NL>
with me at all.<END>

<NL>
I can't figure whether I'm gonna join<NL>
the [Aurochs] or the Crusaders!<END>

<NL>
I'm pretty good at blitz, ya?<NL>
I can hold my breath and everything!<END>

<NL>
They say I gotta train in order<NL>
to join the Crusaders...<END>

<NL>
Me and Sir [Luzzu] and [Gatta] will<NL>
beat [Sin], just the three of us!<END>

<NL>
Dad, come on!<NL>
Let's go help!<END>

<NL>
Yeah, but...<END>

<NL>
Yeah!<END>

<NL>
Let's go help the summoner!<NL>
I promise I'll be a good boy!<END>

<NL>
A summoner came to this village not<NL>
long ago. Now what was his name?<END>

<NL>
Looks like you got<NL>
over the toxin, ya?<END>

<NL>
Sir [Luzzu] and the others aren't back.<NL>
What could have happened?<END>

<NL>
It is true Lady [Yuna]'s a traitor?<NL>
No one here believes that at all!<END>

<NL>
We got letters from the [Aurochs]!<NL>
They're doing great in [Luca], ya?<END>

<NL>
I wonder if [Sin] is really<NL>
going to go away?<END>

<NL>
Long as I'm around, [Besaid]'s weaving<NL>
will be known as nothing but the best!<END>

<NL>
Don't you worry. The summoner will<NL>
return, I know it.<END>

<NL>
Worrying over a few hours delay<NL>
is nothing but a lack of faith!<END>

<NL>
Even should [Sin] come tomorrow,<NL>
life is the same today.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We live and we work.<END>

<NL>
Who cares who they're calling traitor.<NL>
Defeat [Sin], and it'll all be forgotten!<END>

<NL>
Wait for the Calm to come before rejoicing.<NL>
Wouldn't want any...false hope.<END>

<NL>
I am sure that Lord [Braska] is<NL>
watching over our apprentice summoner.<END>

<NL>
On a hot day like today,<NL>
it's best to be in the shade, ya?<END>

<NL>
I wove so much last month. All lost<NL>
when [Sin] destroyed my boat.<END>

<NL>
You the one they say<NL>
came from the sea?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Toxin's still got you, ya?<NL>
You go ahead and rest up.<END>

<NL>
Gone for a night and a day now.<NL>
I'm too worried to speak!<END>

<NL>
Though I'm sure nothing bad is<NL>
happening. Not to that summoner.<END>

<NL>
I'm glad the ferry's on its way,<NL>
but [Sin] will be back, he will.<END>

<NL>
I've heard that the [Crusader]s that<NL>
fought [Sin] were defeated!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
What terrible news! It's because<NL>
they turned their backs on the teachings!<END>

<NL>
When those children calling themselves<NL>
[Crusader]s come back, they're in for a scolding.<END>

<NL>
All these warrior monks were here<NL>
looking for Lady [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
If Lady [Yuna] defeats [Sin] I'm sure<NL>
those nasty rumors will go away.<END>

<NL>
I wonder who was riding<NL>
on that ship in the sky?<END>

<NL>
Everyone in the village is<NL>
all excited about that flying ship.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Heck, I bet all<NL>

If there's anything you need<NL>

[Lulu] knows everything. She'll be a<NL>

I hope your toxin wears off soon.<NEWPAGE>

I'll sneak in a prayer for you<NL>

My dog dug something up<NL>
yesterday. I wonder what it was.<END>

I can't believe [Wakka]'s<NL>
leaving the team.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
With you and [Wakka] there, the [Aurochs]<NL>
would have the winning streak of the century!<END>

<NL>
I wonder if we'll get more customers<NL>
now that the ferry's up and running again.<END>

<NL>
Those monks looking for Lady [Yuna] said<NL>
that only traitors harbor traitors!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Can you believe it? And they're the<NL>
ones guarding the temples?<END>

<NL>
The [Aurochs] are still in [Luca], ya?<NL>
You should pay 'em a visit sometime.<END>

<NL>
What happened to the flying ship?<NL>
I hope it made it through the fight.<END>

Just between me and you, I hear that<NL>
there's no maesters left anymore!<END>

Here, have this.<NL>
This little fella brought it.<NEWPAGE>

I can't figure what it is either.<NL>
You go ahead and take a look.<END>

Who are you, mister?<NL>
Where you from?<END>

<NL>
The apprentice entered the trials,<NL>
and hasn't come back...<END>

I'm sure Lady [Yuna] will have<NL>
lots of stories when she gets back.<END>

Another summoner came here by boat.<NL>
He was a nice guy.<NEWPAGE>

But I like Lady [Yuna] much better!<END>

When the Calm comes, Lady [Yuna]<NL>
has to come back so we can celebrate!<END>

What's a trader? I asked the<NL>
monk, but he won't tell me.<END>

If that flying ship comes back<NL>
I'm gonna sing real loud!<END>

He's got something in his mouth.<END>

Obtained <Cor 43>something<NL>
mangled and slobbery<Cor 41>!<END>

Fiends are around even during the day.<NL>
Take care not to travel alone, ya?<END>

<NL>
You know it's too dangerous.<NL>
Sorry, but you can't pass.<END>

<NL>
I hope the apprentice is well.<END>

<NL>
Instead of just loafing around<NL>
you should be praying, too.<END>

<NL>
Sir [Luzzu] and his troops are on a mission.<NL>
I'm on watch duty.<END>

<NL>
Really, it should've been [Gatta] on watch,<NL>
but he made them take him along, ya?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I guess new recruits are always eager,<NL>
but this ain't no training mission.<END>

<NL>
Like to take a rest?<NL>
Got to keep sharp, ya?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>I'd like a nap.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Maybe later.<END>

<NL>
Compared to the ones we fought during<NL>
the operation, [Besaid] fiends are easy!<END>

<NL>
I did my time in battle!<NL>
Fiends are no problem.<END>

<NL>
That flying ship looked like an [Al Bhed]<NL>
machina to me. Hope it works this time.<END>

<NL>
The Crusaders Lodge is open<NL>
to guests. Take a rest?<END>

<NL>
I want to go to the temple, but<NL>
there's an operation to prepare for.<END>

<NL>
[Wakka] and the others<NL>
are waiting outside!<END>

<NL>
I had a run-in with [Sin]'s<NL>
toxin before too, you know?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm a lot better now, but<NL>
things were pretty bad for a while.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Couldn't remember who I was or<NL>
where I came from! Scary, ya?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Man, I nearly cried,<NL>
and that's the truth!<END>

<NL>
I got better, but only after<NL>
praying at the temple a lot.<END>

<NL>
You should try praying. It worked<NL>
for me--it'll work for you, too.<END>

<NL>
I hope I get over the toxin quick.<NL>
The big operation's coming up!<END>

<NL>
You looking for [Wakka]? The priest<NL>
called him to the temple a while back.<END>

<NL>
I haven't fully healed from [Sin]'s<NL>
toxin so I'm on guard detail.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Don't get me wrong, I'd rather be<NL>
with my buddies.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But I'm a little relieved. This<NL>
operation's gonna be dangerous, you know?<END>

<NL>
You should try praying. It worked<NL>
for me--it'll work for you, too.<END>

<NL>
I'm praying for Sir [Luzzu]'s and the others'<NL>
safety. Yevon knows they'll need it.<END>

<NL>
Of course, with the [Crusader]s excommunicated,<NL>
I'm not supposed to be in the temple.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But the priest let me in special.<NL>
Guess he's not all precepts after all.<END>

<NL>
Just a bunch of empty beds<NL>
without people to sleep in them.<END>

<NL>
I can't believe [Operation Mi'ihen]<NL>
was a failure. I just can't.<END>

<NL>
I just pray everyone makes<NL>
it back okay. Please.<END>

<NL>
Praying won't keep fiends away.<NL>
It takes [Crusader]s to defend [Besaid].<END>

<NL>
The toxin finally wore off. Now to<NL>
make up for all my downtime, ya?<END>

<NL>
The battle with [Sin] ain't over yet...<NL>
I wish there was something we could do.<END>

<NL>
I'm fixing a hole where the<NL>
rain gets in.<END>

<NL>
Rent's free, but I've been working<NL>
like a dog just fixing the place.<END>

<NL>
[Sin]'s struck [Besaid] Village<NL>
so many times I lost count.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
After this house got hit I guess<NL>
the owner just let it be.<END>

<NL>
[Sin] will just come back and<NL>
destroy it again. Sometimes<NL>
I wonder why I bother.<END>

<NL>
He looks pretty weak.<NL>
Maybe he just can't take it.<END>

<NL>
I guess I'll just keep fixing the leaks<NL>
until the [Crusader]s get back.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s sure try hard,<NL>
but I don't think they got what<NL>
it takes to beat [Sin], ya?<END>

<NL>
Sir [Luzzu] and [Gatta] aren't back yet.<NL>
What if they died in battle?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Or maybe they're just so ashamed<NL>
they don't want to come home.<END>

<NL>
Seems the fiends have increased<NL>
with the [Crusader]s gone.<END>

<NL>
I'm no fiend-fighter, so I fix things<NL>
and help the [Crusader]s that way.<END>

<NL>
Sir [Luzzu] won't admit it,<NL>
but he's really down.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I think he feels guilty about<NL>
[Gatta] dying, you know?<END>

<NL>
Sir [Gatta] was gloomy as ever after<NL>
he returned from the operation.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Thankfully, his new post as leader<NL>
of the [Besaid] [Crusader]s seems to<NL>
have lifted his spirits.<END>

<NL>

Took your memory, eh?<END>

It's the machina's fault that so<NL>
many of our [Crusader]s died.<NEWPAGE>

So many lives wasted...<NL>
and for what gain?<END>

You should watch yourself.<NL>
Never go against the teachings.<END>

engagement to [Master Seymor]<NL>

I can't believe Lady [Yuna] would ever<NL>

<NL>
I pray that the next Calm<NL>
will last a long time.<END>

<NL>
Please let the Aurochs<NL>
score at least one goal.<END>

<NL>
[Wakka]'s a guardian.<NL>
He should go help.<END>

<NL>
I'm gonna pray for<NL>
Lady [Yuna] every day!<END>

<NL>
When I was born, Lord [Braska] and<NL>
two guardians came to our village.<END>

<NL>
Let Lady [Yuna] defeat [Sin]...<NL>
Soon...<END>

<NL>
The priest told me the story of<NL>
Lady [Yunalesca] and Lord [Zaon].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
[Spira]'s here today because<NL>
of what Lady [Yunalesca] did.<END>

<NL>
If I was strong like Lord [Zaon]<NL>
I could have been a guardian, too.<END>

<NL>
Only sworn guardians may<NL>
approach the Cloister of Trials.<END>

<NL>
Pray hard, and the toxin will<NL>
surely release its grip on you.<END>

<NL>
The high summoners, in order from<NL>
the right: Lord [Braska], Lady Yocun...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Lord Ohalland, and Lord Gandof.<NL>
Do you remember them now?<END>

<NL>
Putting your transgression aside<NL>
for now, let us celebrate the birth<NL>
of a summoner!<END>

<NL>
Quickly, to the village square!<NL>
Share in our joy!<END>

<NL>
Perhaps your transgression shall<NL>
be pardoned on account of the toxin.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But just this once.<NL>
Follow the teachings, my son.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s are planning an operation<NL>
that defies the teachings of [Yevon2].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It is a pity. The loss of [Chappu] should<NL>
be lesson enough to follow the teachings.<END>

<NL>
You look better than you did yesterday.<NL>
Has [Sin]'s toxin weakened its grip?<END>

<NL>
The summoner undergoes the trials.<NL>
We must not interfere.<END>

<NL>
I've not told the people yet, but I<NL>
hear [Maester Mika2] has passed away.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
What is going on in [Bevelle]?<END>

<NL>
The chaos in the temple only<NL>
serves to worry the people.<END>

<NL>
This ship of the air, could it<NL>
be an [Al Bhed] machina?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm not sure whether to<NL>
cheer or condemn it.<END>

<NL>
Even searching the Scriptures of [Yevon2],<NL>
I have found no cure for [Sin]'s toxin.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
May the blessing of [Yevon2]<NL>
guide you to health, friend.<END>

<NL>
I, too, will pray for the<NL>
blessing of [Yevon2] to shine upon you.<END>

<NL>
My heart is heavy when I think<NL>
of the worst that could happen.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Should the Trials remain unconquered,<NL>
our apprentice has no future.<END>

<NL>
Great strength is only obtained<NL>
through great suffering.<END>

<NL>
Let us greet the [Crusader]s<NL>
warmly when they arrive.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Returning them to the true path<NL>
is my duty as a follower of Yevon.<END>

<NL>
It appears the summoner's pilgrimage<NL>
goes well! Very good, very good.<END>

<NL>
All word from [St. Bevelle]<NL>
has ceased.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
None of the temples know<NL>
which way to turn.<END>

<NL>
You've been a stranger to<NL>
the temples lately, I hear.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Be at peace. Come what may, you<NL>
are always welcome at our temple.<END>

<NL>
Even the teachings of a thousand years<NL>
are due for an update once in a while.<END>

<NL>
Why, if [Sin] is defeated, we may<NL>
no longer need [Yevon2]'s guidance.<END>

<NL>
[Besaid]'s devotion to the teachings<NL>
of [Yevon2] is commendable.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Still, there is much for a priestess<NL>
such as I to teach them.<END>

<NL>
I appreciate the [Crusader]s' zeal,<NL>
but they must heed the teachings.<END>

<NL>
With the statues' guidance, I'm<NL>
sure our apprentice is doing fine.<END>

<NL>
Pray at the temple, and you may<NL>
just overcome [Sin]'s toxin.<END>

<NL>
I don't mean to be rude, but<NL>
some privacy would be appreciated.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I must pray for our apprentice<NL>
summoner, you understand.<END>

<NL>
The people of the village could use<NL>
your help. You should pray, too.<END>

<NL>
I suppose we'll have to call our<NL>
apprentice Lady [Yuna] now.<END>

<NL>
And you, heathen. Know that the<NL>
teachings are the only true guide!<END>

<NL>
The summoner embarks on a perilous<NL>
pilgrimage to save the people.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We must pray from the very<NL>
bottom of our hearts for her success.<END>

<NL>
Fear not! The toxin will heal.<END>

<NL>
I appreciate the [Crusader]s' zeal,<NL>
but they must heed the teachings.<END>

<NL>
The people of the island all pray<NL>
for Lady [Yuna]'s safety.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm doing my part, too.<END>

<NL>
Word of Lady [Yuna]'s achievements<NL>
has reached this island, too.<END>

<NL>
I hear you've become a guardian!<NL>
May you guard Lady [Yuna] well.<END>

<NL>
Even here in [Besaid] we've got<NL>
orders to arrest Lady [Yuna].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Nobody knows what to do, but we<NL>
certainly wouldn't do THAT!<END>

<NL>
Those warrior monks that came to the<NL>
island were just a bunch of crooks, ya?<END>

<NL>
Who can the people of [Yevon2] turn<NL>
to now that [Maester Mika2] is gone?<END>

<NL>
I've followed the teachings of [Yevon2]<NL>
ever since I was a child.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Even should the temple fall,<NL>
I will keep praying. I will.<END>

<NL>
The [Besaid] fabrics they make<NL>
here are famous all over Spira!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If I buy cheap and sell high,<NL>
I'll be rolling in Gil in no time!<END>

<NL>
Take a look. Even with the village<NL>
in turmoil, they just weave away.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Now that's the true sign<NL>
of a professional!<END>

<NL>
Hey, I'm worried too!<NL>
But all we can do is wait.<END>

<NL>
That old coot dropped what he was<NL>
doing to go see the summoner off.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Now I gotta do all his work, too!<NL>
It's just not fair.<END>

<NL>
Sorry, no time to talk.<NL>
Rover starts barking when I slack off.<END>

<NL>
One recruit ain't gonna make<NL>
the [Aurochs] winners!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They'll lose in the first round<NL>
again, leaving us [Luca Goers] to<NL>
pick up the cup!<END>

<NL>
I hear the [Crusader]s' operation goes<NL>
right against the teachings of [Yevon2]!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They're way out of their league, if<NL>
you ask me. Leave [Sin] to the summoners!<END>

<NL>
I heard you whooped 'em good<NL>
at the tournament in [Luca]!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Maybe the [Aurochs]' winning will<NL>
be good for the weaving business, ya?<END>

<NL>
Heard the [Crusader]s got their butts<NL>
kicked. They had it coming, if you ask me.<END>

<NL>
I'm sure impressed<NL>
with the old man, ya?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If [Sin] showed up, I bet he'd stare<NL>
it in the eye and just keep on working!<END>

<NL>
Well, if it ain't the traitors!<NL>
You got some nerve coming here!<END>

<NL>
Hey, hey, just kidding!<NL>
No need to glare, ya?<END>

<NL>
I hear things at the temples are a mess.<NL>
Bad for business, I tell you.<END>

<NL>
I'll admit it, I didn't believe that story<NL>
about the flying ship! Who would?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
When it came flying over town,<NL>
whoowee! I nearly up and died.<END>

<NL>
When that ship came, the old man,<NL>
he kept working while he sang!<END>

<NL>
I travelled Spira looking for a land<NL>
where nobody had heard of [Sin].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I...I gave up looking.<NL>
I think it's for the best.<END>

<NL>
The village where I was born is<NL>
no longer there, thanks to [Sin].<END>

<NL>
The villagers have a lot on their minds.<NL>
You should stay quiet for a while.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Intoxication is no excuse for<NL>
bothering people with questions.<END>

<NL>
Most of the villagers went down<NL>
to say farewell at the dock.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Our summoner's leaving.<NL>
Aw, I've never liked goodbyes.<END>

<NL>
Careful not to break any more precepts,<NL>
or you'll end up like the [Crusader]s!<END>

<NL>
A summoner named Lord [Isaaru] came<NL>
to the village, but he left so soon.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s' operation failed<NL>
as expected, because they used machina!<END>

<NL>
[Operation Mi'ihen] was a crushing loss<NL>
for the [Crusader]s, but they're<NL>
rallying together from every land.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Much better than those warrior monks.<NL>
They're all holed up in [Bevelle], I hear.<END>

<NL>
It's funny that the [Crusader]s are<NL>
the ones protecting us, even after<NL>
being excommunicated.<END>

<NL>
Maybe I should learn [Besaid]<NL>
weaving...make a place for myself here.<END>

<NL>
I doubt some old song is going<NL>
to help anyone beat [Sin].<END>

<NL>
Seafaring is hard work. Gotta kick<NL>
back sometimes. Get some R & R, ya?<END>

<NL>
Is it true that [Sin]<NL>
showed up near here?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Oh boy! And the S.S. Liki's<NL>
scheduled to leave any day now.<END>

<NL>
I sure hope we don't run into<NL>
[Sin] on our next voyage.<END>

<NL>
I saw the apprentice summoner and two<NL>
guardians enter the temple yesterday.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Everything looked alright then.<NL>
But now I'm starting to worry.<END>

<NL>
I do hope they come back safely.<END>

<NL>
I'm gonna kick back in town<NL>
till the next ship gets here.<END>

<NL>
There's no time to rest out there.<NL>
Never know when [Sin] will show up.<END>

<NL>
If you muck around here,<NL>
the ship will leave without you!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
And the next boat won't be here<NL>
for a while. Better hurry, ya?<END>

<NL>
I really, really hope we don't<NL>
run into [Sin] on this voyage.<END>

<NL>
Someone saw an [Al Bhed]<NL>
ship near the island.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Wonder what they're up<NL>
to in these waters?<END>

<NL>
I kinda got to liking this town.<NL>
Maybe I'll give up seafaring.<END>

<NL>
One of my friends is on your ship.<NL>
I'll pray for both of you.<END>

<NL>
I heard the [Guado] blew up<NL>
the [Al Bhed]'s home!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I got no love for the [Al Bhed],<NL>
but that's going too far.<END>

<NL>
No matter what happens in the<NL>
temples, it's life as usual here.<END>

<NL>
Seems kind of odd to pray<NL>
for the temples' sake, ya?<END>

<NL>
That flying ship was spectacular!<NL>
Those [Al Bhed] might have something there.<END>

<END>
