[Tromell]<NL>
I will go inform Lord [Seymor].<NL>
Please wait here.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What could it be?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I haven't done anything<NL>
to make him mad.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I get the feeling he called us up<NL>
here for more than just dinner.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Nothing 'gainst the maester,<NL>
but I hope we get this over with quick.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
There's no temple here<NL>
in [Guadosalam], see?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Summoners usually just pass<NL>
through on their way elsewhere.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
What?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I didn't even ask a question and<NL>
you're explaining things.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You'd rather I say nothing, then?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No, no!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Maybe you finally believe I<NL>
don't know anything about [Spira].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And maybe that means you<NL>
believe me about [Zanarkand], too?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Well...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
There are many things I do not know.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Your [Zanarkand] is<NL>
one of those things.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I suppose I can't say<NL>
what I think either way.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Still, be careful.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You shouldn't tell other people.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, I know.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Why don't you eat something?<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] not like<NL>
Maester [Seymor].<END>

<TEXT>
[Yuna]<NL>
Aa! Shhh!<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] speak no more.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Mmmm! This is good!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Guado] sure know how to eat!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Gee, I wonder what all this is for.<NL>
It's exciting!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Stay on your guard.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why?<NL>
This guy's just a priest, right?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Those with power use that power.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Maesters have power.<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Wait...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You sure you don't have<NL>
something against [Yevon2]?<END>

<TEXT>
<NL>
<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I lived a long time in [Zanarkand].<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Auron]<NL>
What is taking them so long?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Truly, it is good to have guests again.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Since Lord [Jyscal] passed away,<NL>
these halls have been too quiet.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The death of Lord [Jyscal] was<NL>
a great loss for all of [Spira].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Was this Maester [Jyscal]<NL>
really such a great guy?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He brought the teachings<NL>
of [Yevon2] to the [Guado].<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He was truly a great man.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Truly, a loss for us all.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
But now a new leader, Lord<NL>
[Seymor], has come before us.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Lord [Seymor] is the child<NL>
of a [Guado] and a human.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
He will be the tie that<NL>
binds our two races together.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
But that is not all, I think.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Lord [Seymor]...<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
He will surely become the shining<NL>
star that lights the way for all<NL>
the peoples of [Spira].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
That is enough, [Tromell].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Must I always endure such praise?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Welcome!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You...wanted to see me?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Please, make yourselves at home.<NL>
There's no rush.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Please, keep this short.<NL>
[Yuna] must rush.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Pardon me.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
It has been a long time<NL>
since I had guests.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Lady [Yuna], this way.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
This sphere is a reconstruction<NL>
created from the thoughts of the<NL>
dead that wander the [Farplane].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Zanarkand]!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Correct. [Zanarkand]...<NL>
as it looked one thousand years ago.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
The great and wondrous<NL>
machina city, [Zanarkand].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
She once lived in this metropolis.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
She, who?<END>
