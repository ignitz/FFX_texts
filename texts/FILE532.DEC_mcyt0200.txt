[Shelinda]<NL>
Ah! There you are!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
So Lady [Yuna]<NL>
is getting married.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
You shouldn't kid around<NL>
about these things.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Maester [Seymor]<NL>
and Lady [Yuna]...<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I couldn't be happier...<NL>
even if it was my own wedding.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Now, victims of [Sin] will have<NL>
something to be joyful about.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, I guess so.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
You're not happy?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Nah, it's complicated.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Say...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Do you know where [Yuna] is?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I believe...<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
she's gone to the Cloister of<NL>
Trials with Maester [Seymor].<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Ah, Lady [Yuna]'s guardians!<NL>
I haven't thanked you for<NL>
your help earlier.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Thanks to you, I was able to<NL>
bring Lady [Yuna] here safely.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
You have my sincerest gratitude.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
It...isn't much,<NL>
but I want you to have this.<END>

<NL>
Lord [Jyscal]!<END>

<NL>
A sphere, in Lady<NL>
[Yuna]'s belongings...<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Hurray for Maester<NL>
[Seymor]'s wedding!<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Oh, I hear Lady [Yuna] is<NL>
still going to continue<NL>
her journey, ah?<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
I wonder if that means she<NL>
and Maester [Seymor] will<NL>
fight [Sin] together?<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Just like Lady [Yunalesca]<NL>
and Lord [Zaon]!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Please...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Give us a chance to explain.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
No need, I already know<NL>
what I'll tell the other maesters.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Meaning...?<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Lord [Seymor] was the leader<NL>
of the [Guado] before becoming<NL>
a maester.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You're not letting us go.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Let you go? Lord [Seymor] would<NL>
never forgive us if we did.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Wait, wait!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Jyscal]'s sphere!<NL>
We can show it to them!<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
You mean this?<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
The [Guado] take care<NL>
of [Guado] affairs.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Away!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Run!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Please send my best<NL>
regards to Lady [Yuna].<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I am indebted to Lady [Yuna].<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Wherever they are to hold<NL>
the ceremonies, I'll make<NL>
sure to be there.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I will be travelling north<NL>
to tell the people there the<NL>
wonderful news!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
What has happened?<NL>
Is there anything I can do?<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Well... We have much to<NL>
do before the ceremony.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
We are all going to be very busy.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Lord [Seymor] and Lady [Yuna]'s<NL>
marriage will help foster goodwill<NL>
between us and humankind.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Lord [Jyscal], rest his soul,<NL>
would be pleased. I'm sure of it.<END>

<NL>
Entry is not permitted. Lady [Yuna] is<NL>
on her way to the Cloister of Trials.<END>

<NL>
That [Ronso], he...<END>

<NL>
[Bevelle] will hear about this!<END>

<NL>
The high priest of [Macalania Temple]<NL>
was Maester [Seymor].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
A new high priest has not yet<NL>
been appointed in his place.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We await further instructions<NL>
from [St. Bevelle].<END>

<NL>
The temple cannot operate much<NL>
longer without a high priest.<END>

<NL>
Why would the lady<NL>
have such a thing?<END>

<NL>
Before, both humans and [Guado]<NL>
came to pray at the temple.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Now, nobody comes.<NL>
How long before our own hearts<NL>
grow chill and void of faith?<END>

<NL>
There are times when I think about<NL>
quitting the clergy and going home.<END>

<NL>
Those who once criticized the<NL>
[Al Bhed] are now blaming the [Guado].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Hmph, always blaming others for<NL>
everything. Have they no shame?<END>

<NL>
Hmph, the [Ronso] will probably<NL>
be singled out next. Just you watch.<END>

<NL>
We're the life of the party!<NL>
It's our job to be happy and merry!<NL>
Join us!<END>

<NL>
Listen to our magnificent music!<NL>
We'll have a ball!<END>

<NL>
Let us add joy to the wedding<NL>
by contributing our song!<END>

<NL>
Forget about [Sin]'s terror<NL>
for a moment and listen to<NL>
this exquisite piece.<END>

<NL>
Hey, this place is just like mine!<NL>
It's damp and cold and makes me<NL>
sleepy.<END>

<NL>
We'd better start the wedding<NL>
before I get too sleepy.<END>
