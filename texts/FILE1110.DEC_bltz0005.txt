Ten games are played during a <Cor 43>league<Cor 41><NL>
season, with the winner determined<NL>
by total points. 3 points are awarded<NL>
for a win, and 1 point for a tie.<NL>
You can press [Botão Triângulo] to forfeit a game,<NL>
but only when your team is losing.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor 43>Tournaments<Cor 41> span two to three matches.<NL>
There are no draws, so a match ending<NL>
with tied scores goes into overtime.<NL>
You can press [Botão Triângulo] to forfeit a game,<NL>

<TEXT>
<Cor 43>Poison<Cor 41> accelerates the loss of HP<NL>
while the player has the ball.<NL>
Poisoned players do not recover<NL>
HP even when rid of the ball.<NL>
In time, poison runs its course.<END>

<TEXT>
Poison also <Cor 43>disables techniques<Cor 41>.<NL>
Shooting techs are lost first,<NL>
followed by tackling techs and<NL>
passing techs if the poison effects<NL>
are stacked with <Cor 43>Pile Venom<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
A player becomes <Cor 43>unable to act<Cor 41> when put to <Cor 43>sleep<Cor 41>.<NL>
The player will wake after a while, or when he<NL>
is hit by the ball.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor 43>Wither<Cor 41> reduces a single stat by half.<NL>
The effects wear off over time.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor 43>Techniques<Cor 41><TEXT>
<NL>
You can learn blitzball techniques<NL>
by <Cor 43>techcopying<Cor 41> them from opposing players,<NL>
or by <Cor 43>using the prizes<Cor 41> given to the top teams of<NL>
each season or tournament.<END>

<TEXT>
Initially, each player can only<NL>
learn certain techniques.<END>

<TEXT>
But by learning certain <Cor 43>key techniques<Cor 41>,<NL>
a player can increase the number of<NL>
techniques available to him.<END>

<TEXT>
The required key techniques vary by<NL>
player. Each time a player learns a key<NL>
technique, he gains access to a broader<NL>
range of techniques.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor 43>HP<Cor 41><NL>
  - Spent when carrying the ball.<NL>
  - Spent when shooting and passing.<NL>
  - Recovers when moving without the ball.<NL>
  - PA and SH are halved when HP is too low.<END>

In blitzball, players expend<NL>
<Cor 43>HP<Cor 41> to perform actions.<END>

<TEXT>
Think of HP here as <Cor 43>stamina<Cor 41>,<NL>
because players remain conscious<NL>
even if their HP drops to 0.<END>

<TEXT>
The first thing to remember is that<NL>
whoever has the ball steadily loses HP<NL>
while carrying it through the water.<END>

<TEXT>
Watch how [Tidus]'s HP falls<NL>
from <Cor 43><VAR12 30><Cor 41> as he carries the ball.<END>

<TEXT>
As you can see, HP decreases<NL>
when the ball is carried.<END>

<TEXT>
Shooting and passing also<NL>
consume HP. Let's take a look.<END>

<TEXT>
Select <Cor 43>Shoot<Cor 41>.<NL>
Each shot consumes <Cor 43>10<Cor 41> HP.<NL>
Watch closely as [Tidus]<NL>
loses <Cor 43>10<Cor 41> HP.<END>

<TEXT>
As you can see, his HP<NL>
decreased from <Cor 43><VAR12 31><Cor 41> to <Cor 43><VAR12 30><Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
In blitzball, all actions require HP.<END>

<TEXT>
Now let's see what happens<NL>
when HP runs low.<END>

<TEXT>
Players can still shoot even<NL>
if their HP falls below <Cor 43>10<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
But when they do, their shots<NL>
are only <Cor 43>half<Cor 41> as effective.<END>

<TEXT>
Whenever HP is too low, the commands<NL>
are highlighted <Cor 88>blue<Cor 41>. Also, note that<NL>
SH is reduced from <Cor 43>10<Cor 41> to <Cor 43>5<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
Each player slowly regains HP<NL>
once he is rid of the ball.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor B1>Summary 5:<Cor 41><NL>
- Carrying the ball consumes HP.<NL>
- Players regain HP once rid of the ball.<NL>
- Passing and shooting require HP.<NL>
- Insufficient HP reduces PA and SH by half.<END>

<TEXT>
Now let's look at how to <Cor 43>shoot<Cor 41>.<NL>
Shooting is very similar to passing.<END>

<TEXT>
Select <Cor 43>Shoot<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
That is explained elsewhere.<NL>
Please select <Cor 43>Shoot<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
A player's shooting accuracy is displayed as <Cor 43>SH<Cor 41>.<NL>
Check [Tidus]'s SH, now at <Cor 43>10<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
A <Cor 43>goalkeeper<Cor 41> defends the goal<NL>
from [Tidus]'s shots.<END>

<TEXT>
Let's do it.<NL>
Open the command window<NL>
by pressing [Botão Quadrado].<END>

<TEXT>
A shot loses SH as it travels through<NL>
the water, just as a pass loses PA.<END>

<TEXT>
A shot that reaches the goal with<NL>
SH of at least <Cor 43>1<Cor 41> will score.<NL>
If a shot's SH is depleted, it will fail.<END>

<TEXT>
Once you select <Cor 43>Shoot<Cor 41>, the goalkeeper's<NL>
stats appear beneath yours.<END>

<TEXT>
Your teammates' stats are displayed on<NL>
a <Cor 88>blue<Cor 41> background. The opposing team's<NL>
stats are displayed on a <Cor 94>red<Cor 41> background.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor 43>CA<Cor 41> represents the<NL>
goalkeeper's ability to<NL>
catch incoming shots.<END>

<TEXT>
In this example, Raudy's goalkeeping<NL>
ability is shown as <Cor 43>8<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
Let's resume.<NL>
Keep an eye on the shot's<NL>
<Cor 43>SH<Cor 41> as it decreases.<END>

<TEXT>
Check [Tidus]'s <Cor 43>SH<Cor 41> now.<END>

<TEXT>
Here, we take the shot's <Cor 43>SH<Cor 41> and<NL>
subtract the goalkeeper's <Cor 43>CA<Cor 41>..<END>

<TEXT>
If no SH remains,<NL>
then the shot fails.<END>

<TEXT>
Be aware that the actual CA applied<NL>
here is randomized, ranging from 50 to<NL>
150 percent of the goalie's current CA.<END>

<TEXT>
Here the goalkeeper has a CA of <Cor 43>8<Cor 41>,<NL>
so the actual amount subtracted<NL>
may vary from <Cor 43>4<Cor 41> to <Cor 43>12<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
So, let's see whether<NL>
the shot's <Cor 43>SH<Cor 41> score will<NL>
remain above <Cor 43>0<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
Since the shot lost some SH as<NL>
it travelled through the water,<NL>
it is currently at <Cor 43><VAR12 30><Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
The shot was successful<NL>
because SH is at <Cor 43><VAR12 30><Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
Now let's see what happens when you miss a shot.<NL>
Switch to <Cor 43>Manual<Cor 41> movement, swim far<NL>
from the goal, and try shooting from there.<END>

<TEXT>
The shot failed because<NL>
its SH hit <Cor 43>0<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
Now let's try scoring a goal.<NL>
Switch to <Cor 43>Manual<Cor 41> movement, swim closer<NL>
to the goal, and try shooting from there.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor B1>Summary 4:<Cor 41><NL>
- SH represents shooting accuracy.<NL>
- Each shot loses SH the farther it travels.<NL>
- The goalie's CA is subtracted from SH.<NL>
- If final SH is less than or equal to <Cor 43>0<Cor 41>, the shot fails.<END>

<TEXT>
Now, let's take a look at <Cor 43>passing<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
Select <Cor 43>Pass<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
That is explained elsewhere.<NL>
Please select <Cor 43>Pass<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
Select a receiver for your pass.<NL>
His stats are shown at the top right.<END>

<TEXT>
Your pass is complete,<NL>
and now <VAR12 30> has the ball.<END>

<TEXT>
Stats determine the outcome<NL>
of each pass.<END>

<TEXT>
Take a look at the number<NL>
shown next to <Cor 43>PA<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
That number, <Cor 43>10<Cor 41>, represents<NL>
<VAR12 30>'s <Cor 43>passing accuracy<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
Let's pass the ball back to [Tidus].<NL>
Open the command window by pressing [Botão Quadrado].<END>

<TEXT>
Keep an eye on the PA score, now at <Cor 43>10<Cor 41>,<NL>
as the ball travels back to [Tidus].<END>

<TEXT>
Did you notice the gradual<NL>
decrease in PA?<END>

<TEXT>
The friction of the water causes the<NL>
pass's PA to gradually <Cor 43>decrease<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
If its PA reaches <Cor 43>0<Cor 41>, the pass<NL>
becomes uncatchable.<END>

<TEXT>
Now let's watch [Tidus]<NL>
throw a bad pass.<NL>
We'll set his PA to <Cor 43>3<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
Press [Botão Quadrado] and pass the ball.<NL>
Keep an eye on [Tidus]'s PA, now at <Cor 43>3<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
When a pass fails, the ball<NL>
becomes <Cor 43>loose<Cor 41>. A loose ball<NL>
can be claimed by anyone.<END>

<TEXT>
Therefore, a player with high PA can<NL>
successfully throw longer passes.<END>

<TEXT>
Likewise, a player with low PA<NL>
often throws bad passes, giving<NL>
the other team a chance at the ball.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor B1>Summary 3:<Cor 41><NL>
- PA represents passing accuracy.<NL>
- Each pass loses PA the farther it travels.<NL>
- Once PA reaches <Cor 43>0<Cor 41>, the pass becomes uncatchable.<END>

<TEXT>
Now, let's practice passing for a while.<END>

<TEXT>
Please select [Tidus].<END>

<TEXT>
In order to make a player perform<NL>
an action, you must choose an<NL>
<Cor 43>action command<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
You can open the action command window<NL>
by pressing the [Botão Quadrado] button.<END>

<TEXT>
Press [Botão Quadrado] now.<END>

<TEXT>
The game pauses while the action<NL>
command window is open, so you have<NL>
ample time to think about your next move.<END>

<TEXT>
That is explained elsewhere.<NL>
Please select <Cor 43>Dribble<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
There are three available commands:<NL>
<Cor 43>Pass<Cor 41>, <Cor 43>Shoot<Cor 41>, and <Cor 43>Dribble<Cor 41>.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor 43>Dribble<Cor 41> simply makes the<NL>
player resume movement.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor 43>Pass<Cor 41> and <Cor 43>Shoot<Cor 41> are the<NL>
most important commands.<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor B1>Summary 2:<Cor 41><NL>
- [Botão Quadrado] opens the action command window.<NL>
- The three commands are Pass, Shoot, and Dribble.<NL>
- Dribble simply makes the player resume movement.<END>

<TEXT>
Now let's watch the players move.<END>

<TEXT>
It may seem confusing at first,<NL>
but it's actually quite simple.<END>

<TEXT>
By default, player movement is set to <Cor 43>Auto<Cor 41>, so<NL>
everyone moves around the pool automatically.<END>

<TEXT>
Use the <Cor 43>Overhead Map<Cor 41> to<NL>

The triangular frame inside the <Cor 94>red<Cor 41><NL>

<TEXT>
Let's resume.<NL>

Next, let's try moving<NL>
the ball carrier manually.<END>

<TEXT>
Now you've enabled <Cor 43>Manual<Cor 41> movement.<NL>
Press [Direcional Cima][Direcional Baixo][Direcional Esquerda][Direcional Direita] to move the player manually.<END>

<TEXT>
Note that it becomes harder to manage your<NL>
teammates while manually controlling the carrier.<NL>
This mode is recommended for <Cor 43>veteran<Cor 41> blitzers.<END>

<TEXT>
Press [Botão Triângulo] again.<END>

<TEXT>
Now you're back to <Cor 43>Auto<Cor 41> movement.<END>

<Cor B1>Summary 1:<Cor 41><NL>
- Use the <Cor 43>Overhead Map<Cor 41> to keep track of play.<NL>

Try switching between Manual and<NL>
Auto to get a feel for both modes.<END>

<TEXT>
In Manual A mode, the direction of<NL>
movement corresponds to the Overhead Map.<END>

<TEXT>
[Direcional Esquerda] moves the player toward the opposing team's<NL>
goal, and [Direcional Direita] toward your own team's goal.<END>

In addition to Manual A, there is<NL>
also a mode called Manual B. Stick<NL>
