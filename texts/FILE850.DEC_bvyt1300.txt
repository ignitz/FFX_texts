[Tidus]<NL>
Wh-What's that?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
A [fayth].<END>

[Auron]<NL>
They join with the summoner,<NL>
and together receive the aeon.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
They are human souls, imprisoned<NL>
in stone by ancient [Yevon2] rites.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
The dead should be allowed to rest.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna]!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Wait, don't come out!<END>

Fayth<NL>
Hello.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I must thank you for the aeon.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, what's up?<END>

Fayth<NL>
So, have you found a<NL>
way to truly defeat [Sin]?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well...<END>

Fayth<NL>
Well?<END>

Fayth<NL>
Well, come see me when you do.<NL>
We'll talk then.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We think the Hymn of the Fayth<NL>
might slow [Sin] down.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Hmm...<NL>
Perhaps.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You mean, it won't work?<END>

Fayth<NL>
A very long time has passed<NL>
since your father became [Sin].<END>

Fayth<NL>
He may not be able to<NL>
hear the hymn anymore.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I know it's a long shot...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But we gotta try<NL>
it if there's a chance.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Yes, you must.<END>

Fayth<NL>
I'm glad you're doing this.<END>

Fayth<NL>
You have a good spirit, truly.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm not just a dream, right?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
A dream?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh... It's a long story.<END>

Fayth<NL>
If it works, what'll you do then?<NL>
You need more than the hymn.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Well?<END>

Fayth<NL>
You'll need more than that.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We fight Yu Yevon.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Yes...<END>

Fayth<NL>
If you defeat Yu Yevon, it will end.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Tell me, what do you<NL>
know about Yu Yevon?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
He's what makes [Sin] come back!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Sin] is his armor.<NL>
It protects him.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Yu Yevon was once<NL>
a summoner, long ago.<END>

Fayth<NL>
He was peerless.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Yet now he lives for<NL>
one purpose: only to summon.<END>

Fayth<NL>
He is neither good, nor evil.<NL>
He is awake, yet he dreams.<END>

Fayth<NL>
But...maybe not forever.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, that's right.<NL>
Because we're ending it.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Yes.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Even if you defeat [Sin] with the<NL>
Final Summoning, Yu Yevon will live.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Yu Yevon will join<NL>
with the Final Aeon.<END>

Fayth<NL>
He will transform it<NL>
into a new [Sin].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yu Yevon merges with the aeon...<END>

Fayth<NL>
Then, protected by this new<NL>
[Sin] he has created,<NL>
Yu Yevon continues the summoning.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
For eternity...huh?<END>

Fayth<NL>
But you know, there is<NL>
no such thing as eternity<NL>
if you end it, is there?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh-huh.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Yu Yevon lives inside [Sin].<END>

Fayth<NL>
[Yuna], listen.<END>

Fayth<NL>
When you fight Yu Yevon,<NL>
we will help you.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Promise me you'll summon us.<END>

Fayth<NL>
I'm afraid your swords and<NL>
magic won't be enough.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Please, call us.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Promise?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes.<END>

Fayth<NL>
But, you know...<END>

Fayth<NL>
When it is all over...<END>

Fayth<NL>
we will wake,<NL>
and our dream will end.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Our dream will vanish.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You've been dreaming<NL>
a long time, haven't you?<END>

Fayth<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm grateful.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
About what?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, nothing.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, don't make that face!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Come on! We're going to beat [Sin]!<NL>
Let's see some cheer, okay?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You're hiding something.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm not!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Really?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You're a bad liar, you know?<END>
