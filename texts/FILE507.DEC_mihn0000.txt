<NL>
Do you know what those ruins are from?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Some old city?<END>

<NL>
Correct. A city most ancient!<END>

<NL>
A terrible testament to [Sin]'s power.<NL>
I tremble every time I see them.<END>

<NL>
Compared to [Sin], humans<NL>
are mere mudpuppies!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But I believe humans are the only<NL>
ones capable of defeating [Sin].<END>

<NL>
A good reply. I am relieved to hear<NL>
you say that, m'lady summoner.<END>

<NL>
Where are my manners? I am [Maechen],<NL>
a scholar. At your service, m'lady.<NL>
<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
I am on a journey, studying the<NL>
history of our world, [Spira],<NL>
seeking its stories and secrets...<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
My travels have taken me<NL>
to many places, and I am troubled<NL>
by what I have seen.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Fragile smiles on people's faces<NL>
crumbling at the mere mention of [Sin].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
They are counting on you, m'lady.<NL>
Give them a reason<NL>
to rejoice once more.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I will.<END>

<NL>
This is a statue of Lord [Mi'ihen].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
This is a statue of Lord [Mi'ihen].<END>

<NL>
Eight centuries ago, he founded a<NL>
legion known today as the [Crusader]s.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Eight centuries ago, he founded a<NL>
legion known today as the [Crusader]s.<END>

<NL>
In just a few short years after<NL>
their founding, their ranks grew<NL>
throughout [Spira].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
In just a few short years after<NL>
their founding, their ranks grew<NL>

<NL>
The maesters of [Yevon2] feared<NL>
an uprising and accused them<NL>
of rebellion.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
The maesters of [Yevon2] feared<NL>
an uprising and accused them<NL>

<NL>
So Lord [Mi'ihen] walked along this<NL>
very road to go face their charges<NL>
and refute them.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
So Lord [Mi'ihen] walked along this<NL>
very road to go face their charges<NL>

<NL>
He succeeded in winning the<NL>
maesters' trust, and his legion<NL>
became an arm of the [Yevon2] clergy.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>

It was then that [Yevon2] gave<NL>

which they have kept ever since.<END>

It was then that [Yevon2] gave<NL>

And the rest is history.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And the rest is history.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Ah, Lady [Yuna]'s guardians,<NL>
I presume?<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Although this is a highroad, fiends<NL>
do appear. Be on your guard!<END>

<NL>
Although this is a highroad,<NL>
fiends do appear. Be on your guard!<END>

<NL>
Lady Summoner, I presume?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes, I am [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
I am [Lucil], captain of<NL>
the [Djose] Chocobo Knights.<END>

<NL>
And I'm [Elma]. We've been<NL>
charged to guard the Highroad.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
There have been reports of a large<NL>
fiend appearing in this area,<NL>
with a taste for chocobos.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Do take care, Summoner [Yuna],<NL>
if you are to rent any chocobos.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thank you. We will be careful.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Good. We should get back<NL>
to our rounds. Farewell.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Our prayers are with you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
A large fiend...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's go get him!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Why?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's the right thing to do.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It's the right thing to do?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What'd I say now?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Jecht] said that a lot, too.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
And every time he said it,<NL>
it meant trouble for [Braska] and me.<END>

<NL>
Ah, a summoner party.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You, too, are a summoner?<END>

<NL>
My name is [Belgemine].<NL>
You are...?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
My name is [Yuna].<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Ah, the high summoner's daughter.<NL>
I've heard much of you.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
But you are still fresh<NL>
on the road, are you not?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes, I am.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I might have a few<NL>
things to teach you.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Let us see which are stronger.<NL>
My aeons or yours.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
A one-on-one match.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Not to the death, of course.<NL>
What do you say?<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Well, it's your decision.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Tell me if you change your mind.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Have you changed your mind?<NL>
You wish to train?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'll do my best!<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Good.<NL>
Before we begin...<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Your aeons have been healed. You can<NL>
fight with your full strength. Come.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Not bad for one so young.<NL>
I underestimated you.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Take this.<NL>
You've earned it.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
You need more training.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
But you did well.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
You show promise.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
With more training,<NL>
you could defeat [Sin].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thank you!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But I think you might defeat<NL>
[Sin] before I am able to.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I cannot.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Or should I say...<NL>
I was not able to.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You mean...<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Farewell, [Yuna].<NL>
We'll meet again.<END>

<NL>
Hey there, guardians. Here.<NL>
Use this to defend our summoner well.<END>

<NL>
You're a guardian, right?<NL>
I'd like to give you this.<END>

<NL>
Please give this to the lady summoner<NL>
as a token of my gratitude.<END>

<NL>
I hear some big operation's about to start.<END>

<NL>
I don't know what the [Crusader]s<NL>
are up to, but I say they're way<NL>
out of their league.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Let the summoners take care of Sin.<NL>
It's the only way!<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s can't beat [Sin].<NL>
History's proven that.<END>

<NL>
Where is he?<END>

<NL>
I got separated from my brother.<NL>
I told him to meet here if that happened!<END>

<NL>
We have to get back home<NL>
before the operation starts!<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s are really active.<END>

<NL>
I heard that [Crusader]s are marching<NL>
in from all over [Spira].<END>

<NL>
Mum's the word. I hear the temples of<NL>
[Yevon2] are in on this, too.<END>

<NL>
Please rest assured. On [Guado]'s<NL>
honor, we will guard the Highroad.<END>

<NL>
We should never forget the<NL>
folly of [Operation Mi'ihen].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Such a tragedy must never<NL>
happen again.<END>

<NL>
The operation's failure should<NL>
prove a good lesson to those<NL>
who shun the teachings.<END>

<NL>
I hear the ferry's back in service.<END>

<NL>
There are seven legends about<NL>
Lord Mi'ihen's statue...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
but they're all so absurd!<END>

<NL>
They say the eyes follow you when<NL>
you're not looking, and that it gets up<NL>
and walks around in the night!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Silly, isn't it?<END>

<NL>
There's a legend that Lord Mi'ihen's<NL>
sword still exists somewhere.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I think it's just an ancient myth.<END>

<NL>
I see a large shadow in the sky sometimes.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's too big to be a bird.<NL>
What could it be?<END>

<NL>
Maybe... Nah, it can't be.<END>

<NL>
I wonder if somebody's riding that thing.<END>

<NL>
Fiends are lurking everywhere.<NL>
I have to be on my toes constantly.<END>

<NL>
They really need to guard<NL>
the Highroad better.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
The [Crusader]s, the warrior monks, I don't<NL>
care who handles it, as long as it's safe.<END>

<NL>
I suppose it's too much to ask to<NL>
secure a remote area like this one.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Out here, it's every man for himself.<END>

<NL>
There's gotta be something here...<NL>
I can feel it.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But no matter how hard I look,<NL>
I can't find a thing.<END>

<NL>
There should be inscriptions<NL>
of some sort here.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Aw, well... I probably wouldn't<NL>
be able to read them anyway.<END>

<NL>
Hey! What's that?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Ha!<NL>
Made you look!<END>

<NL>
A lot of people are leaving [Bevelle]. I hear the<NL>
temple's really clamping down on things there.<END>

<NL>
I hear the priests worry more about<NL>
themselves than the people.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If [Maester Mika2] were still alive,<NL>
this never would've happened.<END>

<NL>
Maybe [Sin] fell on [Bevelle] to punish<NL>
the temple and what it's become.<END>

<NL>
From what I hear, [Sin]'s crash into<NL>
[Bevelle] has wreaked utter havoc on<NL>
the city.<END>

<NL>
I hope my warrior-monk cousin<NL>
in [Bevelle] is all right.<END>

<NL>
I wish somebody would<NL>
hurry up and destroy [Sin].<END>

<NL>
Lord Mi'ihen once passed<NL>
along this road.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
With the [Crusader]s in disarray,<NL>
I hope to find his guidance here.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s shouldn't<NL>
focus just on fighting [Sin].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We should strive to establish<NL>
peace more than anything.<END>

<NL>
Time to buck up and get to work.<END>

<NL>
We all had a swell time singing<NL>
when that ship flew over us.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But we can't truly rejoice<NL>
until the Calm comes.<END>

<NL>
I wonder what's gonna happen to [Spira].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm getting all discombobulated<NL>
thinking about it too much.<END>

<NL>
I guess whatever happens happens.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
You have to leave your chocobos here.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Come on, everyone off!<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
All the other [Crusader]s are<NL>
preparing for the operation.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
But they put me here on guard duty.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
This is all I'm good for anyway.<END>

<NL>
Hello!<NL>
No charge this time!<END>
