[Yuna]<NL>
Everyone...wait.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What's up?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I have something to tell you.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Here?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
We're almost out of here! Let's go!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I have to say it now!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Over there.<END>

<NL>
Somehow, my bad feelings<NL>
always come true.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I've decided to marry.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I thought so.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
B-But why?<NL>
Why'd you change your mind?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
For [Spira]'s future...<NL>
and [Yevon2]'s unity.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I thought it would<NL>
be the best thing to do.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
That's not good enough.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Wait, is it...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Is it because of Lord [Jyscal]?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey! That sphere!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Show me.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You're kidding, ya?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
As you wish.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Wait a minute, [Auron]!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
No, I'm not.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But that's...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Yuna], just one question.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Can't you just talk<NL>
to Maester [Seymor]?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You've got to marry him?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I don't know.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But I think it is the right thing to do.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Okay, I guess.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Yunie]...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Quiet!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I wish we could help somehow, some way!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's okay...<NL>
I'll be fine.<END>

<NL>
She says, "I'm sorry."<NL>
He says, "It's fine."<END>

<NL>
She's "willing" to face [Sin].<NL>
She's "privileged."<END>

<NL>
I didn't understand.<END>

<NL>
But somehow,<NL>
I felt like I didn't belong.<END>

<NL>
But if I didn't belong with them,<NL>
I'd be stuck in [Spira], alone.<END>

<NL>
And being alone in that place, well,<NL>
I didn't want to think about it.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Next, we're going<NL>
to <Cor 88>[Macalania Temple]<Cor 41>.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Yuna] can talk with<NL>
[Seymor] there.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
We guardians will wait until they're<NL>
done, and plan our next move.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Understood?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I can't.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I must speak to<NL>
Maester [Seymor] first.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I truly am sorry,<NL>
but this is...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It is a personal matter.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Just one thing.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I won't quit my pilgrimage.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Then it is...fine.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You don't care? I mean,<NL>
you're not going to stop her?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
As long as she is<NL>
willing to face [Sin]...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
all else is her concern.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
That is a summoner's privilege.<NL>
As long as she journeys.<END>
