Let's go!<END>

<NL>
Fire!<END>

<TEXT>
[Lucil]<NL>
Charge!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It won't work anyway.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Don't say that.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It might be a hopeless campaign,<NL>
and it might mean defying [Yevon2]...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But the [Crusader]s and the [Al Bhed]--<NL>
they're doing their best to defeat [Sin].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
They want to rid [Spira]<NL>
of [Sin] forever.<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And that's just what<NL>
we want, too, isn't it?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Isn't it?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hmph! All right, all right!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But I still think machina are bad news.<NL>
They're forbidden for a reason!<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Lady Summoner!<NL>
There you are!<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
The command center is that way.<NL>
[Maester Kinoc] is also there.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Maester Kinoc], too?<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Yes. Please hurry, my lady.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
The operation will begin shortly.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Please check all your equipment.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Um, you all right?<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Of course not!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
I came here to fight [Sin]!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
But they stick me here!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
If you want to prove yourself...<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
first you must complete<NL>
the tasks you are given.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Just doing what they say?<NL>
It just won't be enough.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
That's right!<NL>
It's not fair!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
You'd think the same if you were me.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
I'll do something...even if<NL>
it means bending the rules.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
I've got to show<NL>
[Luzzu] what I can do.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
I'd heard from [Seymor], but I<NL>
didn't know if we'd actually meet.<END>

<NL>
Good to see you, [Auron]!<NL>
Ten years, is it?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Lulu]<NL>
That's Wen [Kinoc], one of<NL>
the Four Maesters of [Yevon2].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
He leads the warrior monks and<NL>
also commands the [Crusader]s.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
All troops ready to move<NL>
at your command, sir!<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
Good. Dismissed.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Sir!<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
Tell me, [Auron]. Where have<NL>
you been the last ten years?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
We don't have time<NL>
for this now, do we?<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
This plan won't work, you know that.<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
We'll just let them<NL>
dream a little longer.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Lord [Kinoc]...<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
Oh, yes. Proceed.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
That [Kinoc], a maester?<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
I heard that, [Auron].<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
A lot has happened the last ten years.<NL>
What were you doing, and where?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Fulfilling a promise I made<NL>
to a friend. I still am.<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
Just tell me one thing:<NL>
Have you seen [Zanarkand]?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Go to [Yuna].<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
Being a maester has its privileges.<NL>
I can just sit here and watch.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
With them here, it's like [Yevon2]<NL>
authorizes this whole operation!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Anything could happen.<NL>
Make sure you're ready for combat.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm a little nervous.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I kinda...think we don't belong here.<END>

<NL>
It is time at last.<END>

<NL>
We must tell the [Al Bhed] waiting outside<NL>
to begin the operation at once.<END>

<NL>
The fiends may break through.<NL>
This place is not safe.<END>

<NL>
Make sure you're prepared<NL>
to defend yourselves.<NL>
Tell me when you're ready.<END>

<NL>
Are you ready?<END>

<NL>
Please hurry.<END>

<NL>
[Maester Kinoc]. Please.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Will [Sin] come?<END>

<NL>
[Sin] always returns for its spawn.<END>

<NL>
To make sure, we're going to<NL>
encourage them to call out to it.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
You won't have to.<NL>
It'll come.<END>

<NL>
I remembered [Auron] telling me.<END>

<NL>
[Sin] is my old man.<NL>
[Sin] is [Jecht].<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Look out!<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
What can I do for ya?<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Monopoly's a great thing! Things are<NL>
sellin' no matter what the price!<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Oops! Sorry, I forgot.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Welcome to [O'aka]'s!<END>

<NL>
We're only moments away from<NL>
commencing [Operation Mi'ihen].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
[Spira]'s fate hangs on the<NL>
outcome of this mission.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We will do our duty as soldiers<NL>
and defeat [Sin] this day!<END>

<NL>
Sir!<END>

<NL>
Man, you'd think he'd shut up<NL>
after five times--or was that six?<END>

<NL>
The captain just keeps repeating himself.<NL>
He must be really nervous.<END>

<NL>
It's important to spur my men on every<NL>
now and then. Maybe I should give<NL>
them another pep talk to be sure...<END>

<NL>
The operation will begin momentarily.<NL>
Please do not leave this area.<END>

<NL>
Please remain within this area.<END>

<NL>
We have the ancient [machina].<NL>
The operation will succeed.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Our [machina] will prove that<NL>
[Yevon2]'s teachings are not the way.<END>

<NL>
A [summoner]...<NL>
I shall report this later.<END>

<NL>
Being around [Yevon2]'s<NL>
followers makes me sick.<END>

<NL>
We're inspecting the<NL>
weapons right now.<END>

<NL>
They're [Al Bhed] machina, so<NL>
we have to be extra cautious.<END>

<NL>
So far so good.<NL>
I'm gonna run more tests.<END>

<NL>
Come on!<NL>
Swing like a man!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Do you wanna avenge your<NL>
sister or don't you?<END>

<NL>
Okay, come on now!<NL>
Pretend I'm a fiend!<END>

<NL>
I'm gonna beat [Sin]!<NL>
I'm gonna beat it!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm gonna beat it no matter what!<END>

<NL>
Die, die, die!<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Yeah, you should be out on the front lines.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Guarding the command center is important, too.<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Not yet.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Yes.<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Got any weapons?<NL>
<CHOICE2>Got any items?<NL>
<CHOICE3>Leave.<END>

<NL>
Yeah? What do you wanna know?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>About the cannons.<NL>
<CHOICE2>About the Chocobo Knights.<NL>
<CHOICE3>About this operation.<NL>
<CHOICE4>Never mind.<END>

<NL>
The [Al Bhed2] provided us with<NL>
these cannons at no charge.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I hate the bastards, but I've got<NL>
a little respect for them now.<END>

<NL>
These cannons have good range.<NL>
We'll give [Sin] a shower it<NL>
won't soon forget!<END>

<NL>
Only a select few can become<NL>
Chocobo Knights.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
You have to be a skilled rider or<NL>
achieve some combat merit to become one.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Captain [Lucil] is no doubt the best<NL>
of the bunch right now.<END>

<NL>
I just don't know how that wimp [Clasko]<NL>
got knighted.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Well, he is good at earning<NL>
their trust--the chocobos, that is.<END>

<NL>
We've researched [Sin]'s past behaviors<NL>
in planning this operation.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
[Sin] often turns up where its [sinspawn] are.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
So we hunted down the [sinspawn] at various<NL>
places and brought them here to lure it.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
When it shows up, we're gonna hit it with<NL>
the ancient machina, and it's bye-bye [Sin].<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s' responsibility is<NL>
to lure [Sin] and immobilize it.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
The [Al Bhed] will deliver the<NL>
finishing blow.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I wish it could be the other way around,<NL>
but as long as we defeat [Sin], who cares.<END>

<NL>
I'm short on various stuff,<NL>
so I'm trying to buy them now.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Everything seems a bit pricier than usual.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
Well, I guess I should just be thankful.<NL>
I never imagined I could buy stuff out here.<END>

<NL>
Time to shop!<END>

<NL>
That merchant's obviously<NL>
ripping people off.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I guess it can't be helped.<NL>
He's the only game out here.<END>

<NL>
I asked him for a discount, and<NL>
do you know what he said to me?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
"Ye gonna die anyway,<NL>
so what's the point?"<END>

<NL>
I wonder what that merchant's gonna do<NL>
when the battle starts.<END>
