<NL>
This walkway's not as sturdy<NL>
as she used to be. But hey,<NL>
no one's fallen through yet!<END>

<NL>
[Sin]'s been quiet lately, I hear.<NL>
Probably off somewhere saving all<NL>
its energy for a big assault.<END>

<NL>
The Calm's still not here yet,<NL>
is it... What are those people<NL>
on that flying ship doing, anyway?<END>

<NL>
We're nearly done repairing<NL>
the damage from [Sin]'s attack.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Folk seem to be in good<NL>
spirits these days, but...<NL>
Take a closer look at them.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They're watching the sea, they are,<NL>
and there's terror in their eyes.<END>

<NL>
The village may have recovered, but<NL>
people's hearts are still heavy.<END>

<NL>
You can always fix what's broken,<NL>
but you can't bring back the dead.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I have to learn to accept<NL>
the reality of the situation.<END>

<NL>
I'm sure that our song reached<NL>
the people on the [Farplane].<END>

<NL>
Well, the [Crusader]s' operation ended<NL>
in failure. I knew it would.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
[Sin] attacked our homes!<NL>
We know its horror all too well.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
The sooner we all accept our fate,<NL>
the sooner we can get on with our lives.<END>

<NL>
What were the [Crusader]s trying<NL>
to prove? I just don't get it.<END>

<NL>
Now that we've finally rebuilt the<NL>
village, I'm just praying that [Sin]<NL>
doesn't attack again.<END>

<NL>
I pray each day for a future where my<NL>
grandchildren can sleep in peace.<END>

<NL>
Well, look at the time.<NL>
I'd better be on my way<NL>
to pray at the temple.<END>

<NL>
Well, now. I forgot<NL>
what I was up to.<END>

<NL>
[Sin] is a punishment upon [Yevon2]'s<NL>
people, yet I fear that no amount<NL>
of atonement will end its ravages.<END>

<NL>
My grandchildren are on the<NL>
[Farplane]. How I wish they<NL>
could have heard the hymn.<END>
