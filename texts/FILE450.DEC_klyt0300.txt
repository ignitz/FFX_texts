<NL>
I'm going to pray real hard<NL>
so that Sin doesn't come back here.<END>

<NL>
The Goers and the Aurochs<NL>
are going down!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I guarantee you, the Beasts are<NL>
gonna take home the cup this year!<END>

<NL>
I hear [Sin] has gone far away.<NL>
My prayers were answered.<END>

<NL>
Did you hear? When you see the flying ship,<NL>
we're all to sing the Hymn of the Fayth.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Supposedly, it has something to do with<NL>
overcoming [Sin], but I wonder if it's true?<END>

<NL>
I'm still a bit skeptical,<NL>
but I guess it's worth trying.<END>

<NL>
So, uh... I sang the Hymn of the Fayth,<NL>
but what's supposed to happen?<END>

<NL>
Climbing those stone steps every day has kept<NL>
me in shape. Haven't caught a cold in years.<END>

<NL>
I used to be a blitzer back in my day.<NL>
Always vying with the other teams.<END>

<NL>
I recognize your face, sonny.<NL>
You were here praying for victory, right?<END>

<NL>
Not many visitors at the temple these days.<NL>
It is a pity, really.<END>

<NL>
We've decided to leave Kilika, and<NL>
look for a place without Sin.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Who knows if we'll ever find it.<END>

<NL>
The Goers look like a pretty good team,<NL>
but they're so stuck up, aren't they?<END>

<NL>
I've had enough of Kilika.<NL>
Too many tearful memories here.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We came to visit the temple one last<NL>
time before we leave for good.<END>

<NL>
I just saw a summoner and her guardian<NL>
enter the Cloister of Trials.<END>

<NL>
When we were training in the forest,<NL>
I was confident the operation would succeed.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But looking back now, I've come to<NL>
realize how foolish and naive we were.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It was a mistake to go against precepts<NL>
that have stood for a thousand years.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s of [Kilika] will disband<NL>
soon, and regroup as warrior monks.<END>

<NL>
I've givin' up on becoming a warrior monk.<NL>
They favor the temple over the people of Spira.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I can't believe they abandoned their<NL>
positions in [Kilika] and ran off.<END>

<NL>
The warrior monk leaders have<NL>
barricaded themselves in St. [Bevelle].<END>

<NL>
I hear the Crusaders are going to fight<NL>
Sin without the aid of a summoner.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Heh, they've got another thing coming.<NL>
Haven't they ever heard of divine retribution?<END>

<NL>
Seeing blitzball players here is a sure<NL>
sign that the tournament is approaching.<END>

<NL>
I have quit the [Crusader]s and have joined<NL>
the warrior monks to protect the temple!<END>

<NL>
The warrior monk I respect most is Sir [Auron],<NL>
the legendary guardian of High Summoner [Braska]!<END>

<NL>
No, no, I am not a warrior monk!<NL>
I have rejoined the [Crusader]s.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's just that we [Crusader]s<NL>
are short on armor.<END>

<NL>
[Crusader]... warrior monk... Who cares?<NL>
I just want to protect something!<END>

<NL>
I heard famous people come here.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Where could they be?<END>

<NL>
Wait a minute.<NL>
Could they have been the celebrities?<END>

<NL>
I still have terrible nightmares<NL>
of [Sin] attacking our port.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
As a monk, I should be strong enough<NL>
to confront my fears, but I cannot!<NL>
I am so ashamed!<END>

<NL>
I must be strong and live by the<NL>
teachings in this time of turmoil!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But lately, I have discovered<NL>
a weakening of my faith.<END>

<NL>
I must focus on my training<NL>
for as long as I am a monk.<END>

<NL>
Is that flying ship one of Yevon's machina?<NL>
Yes, let us assume so.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You here to pray for victory, too?<END>

<NL>
Us? Pray?<END>

<NL>
Who needs to pray?<NL>
The [Luca Goers] always win!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Oh, yeah?<NL>
Then why are you here?<END>

<NL>
We've been praying for<NL>
some competition this year! <END>

<NL>
So, what's your goal this time?<NL>
You gonna "do your best" again?<END>

<NL>
Ha! It's too bad your<NL>
best isn't good enough!<NL>
Why even bother showing up?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
This time, we play to win!<END>

<NL>
Oooh! Play away! Just remember<NL>
even kids can play, boys.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
See you in the finals!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We'll beat them.<NL>
We have to!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You know that team?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Putting people down...<NL>
They're as bad as my old man!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But, Sir [Jecht] was<NL>
a kind and gentle man!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, not my [Jecht].<END>

<NL>
Even ten years after he left...<END>

<NL>
just thinking about my old man<NL>
got me angry. But maybe that was<NL>
just my way of keeping him... Nah.<END>

<NL>
I thought I had put my feelings<NL>
for [Zanarkand] behind me.<END>

<NL>
But they were there, and they<NL>
grew inside me, bigger and bigger,<NL>
till I was just about ready to burst.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Are...are you okay?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I...I don't know.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What do you want to do?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
To scream real loud.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

Datto<NL>
You sure are talented, man. Playing<NL>
blitzball and fighting like that!<END>

Datto<NL>
I came here last year to pray for<NL>
victory, but we lost in the first round.<NEWPAGE>
Datto<NL>
I guess I didn't pray hard enough, ya?<END>

Datto<NL>
My poor knees were shakin'<NL>
when the Goers confronted me.<END>

Letty<NL>
So this is the place remembered in<NL>
honor of High Summoner [Ohalland]...<NL>
Makes you kind of nervous, ya?<END>

Letty<NL>
All these flames around the temple...<NEWPAGE>
Letty<NL>
They've always burned strong, ever<NL>
since [High Summoner Ohalland]'s time.<END>

Letty<NL>
That was Bickson.<NL>
He's a jerk, but a first-rate blitzer.<END>
