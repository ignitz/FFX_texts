[Wakka]<NL>
Whoa, whoa, whoa!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It was [Dona] and that<NL>
big musclehead man!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna] will be the one<NL>
to suffer the consequences!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What consequences?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
She could be excommunicated!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The chamber beyond is a sacred<NL>
place. Only summoners may enter.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What, even guardians can't go?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It's taboo!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Just wait.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, what's in there anyway?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
The [fayth], remember?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh yeah, that thing. Right.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The [fayth] are people who<NL>
gave their lives to battle [Sin].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yevon2] took their souls, willingly<NL>
given from their still-living bodies.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Now they live forever,<NL>
trapped in statues.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
But when a summoner beckons, the<NL>
souls of the [fayth] emerge once again.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
That's what we call an aeon.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
All that in this room?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
S-So what's [Yuna]<NL>
doing in there?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
She prays with all her heart<NL>
for a way to defeat [Sin].<END>

<NL>
<NL>
There was something I didn't<NL>
tell anyone else that day.<END>

<NL>
That song we heard there, in the temple...<NL>
I knew it from my childhood.<END>

<NL>
It was proof that [Spira] and<NL>
[Zanarkand] were connected somehow.<NL>
At least to me it was.<END>

<NL>
Maybe that's why, suddenly, I felt<NL>
like...I just wanted to go home.<END>

<NL>
I tried to say something, to tell them.<NL>
But the words wouldn't come.<END>

<END>
