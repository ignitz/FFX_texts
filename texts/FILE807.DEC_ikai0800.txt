[Lulu]<NL>
I need to be alone right now.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I hope I'll bring back...good news.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Oh, my poor Lord [Seymor]...<NL>
Tell me, where do you wander?<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Lord [Jyscal]!<NL>
I beg your forgiveness!<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Even should [Sin] disappear, the<NL>
[Guado] are doomed without a leader.<END>

<NL>
Thanks to the summoner's sending<NL>
the fallen ones to the [Farplane]...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
we were able to reunite with our son,<NL>
who was killed in battle.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Words cannot express how<NL>
grateful we are.<END>

<NL>
The summoner's sending has saved<NL>
our son from becoming a fiend.<END>

<NL>
Our son was killed in<NL>
[Operation Mi'ihen].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We begged him not to go,<NL>
but...<END>

<NL>
Never did I imagine our son<NL>
would depart before our time.<END>

<NL>
The two figures you see there<NL>
are not his mother and father.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Actually, they are my parents,<NL>
who passed away decades ago.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They died young, but I was fortunate<NL>
enough to have grandchildren.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
My parents must have been watching<NL>
over me from the [Farplane].<END>

<NL>
It feels quite strange to look<NL>
older than your own parents.<END>

<NL>
They look exactly<NL>
like my mom and dad.<END>

<NL>
All your hard work and effort to<NL>
become a monk has been in vain.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Oh, how I was looking<NL>
forward to that day.<END>

<NL>
Rest in peace on the [Farplane].<NL>
We shall join you soon.<END>

<NL>
I hope you live your next life<NL>
in a world without [Sin].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Do not return to [Spira].<END>

<NL>
Those who are born into [Spira]<NL>
are destined to live a life of sorrow.<END>
