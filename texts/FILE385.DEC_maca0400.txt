<NL>
"Praise be to [Yevon2]."<END>

<NL>
That's what I would have said,<NL>
if I was a follower of [Yevon2].<END>

<NL>
We were all there,<NL>
and in one piece.<END>

<NL>
Even if I had a headache<NL>
from wondering what was<NL>
in store for us next.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
"What now?"<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You act first and<NL>
think later, don't you?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I mean, can't you be a little<NL>
more responsible? We're all<NL>
depending on you. You know?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No, no, no.<NL>
Just a suggestion.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Is that a lecture?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, [Wakka], would you cheer up?<NL>
Look, we only did what we had to do.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It doesn't matter!<NL>
Don't you see?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I've always walked the<NL>
path of [Yevon2]...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
but now, I'm a traitor.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
How could this happen?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Damn.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's not [Rikku]'s fault either.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You don't know how I feel.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I'm sure [Yunie]'s okay.<NL>
She's breathing fine and all.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
How are [Lulu] and [Wakka]?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, [Wakka]'s in shock.<NL>
Can't blame him, either.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And [Lulu], well, she's<NL>
just the same as always.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
She's so together.<NL>
All grown up, I guess.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I guess.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Well, just give me five or six more years.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, [Kimahri], how<NL>
do we get out of here?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Hey, don't change the subject!<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
We climb.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Kimahri, too!<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Only those who try will become.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I think he means you have to work<NL>
hard if you want to be like [Lulu].<END>

<TEXT>
[Rikku]<NL>
Oh! I will!<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] think [Rikku]<NL>
should stay [Rikku].<END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Wakka]<NL>
How can you laugh<NL>
at a time like this!?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna]!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I wanted to confront Maester [Seymor]<NL>
about his father, Lord [Jyscal].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I wanted to convince him to turn<NL>
himself in to [Yevon2]'s judgement.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
In exchange for marriage?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes, if that's what it took.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, what did [Seymor] say?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
He didn't say anything.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Now...now I don't even<NL>
think it was worth it.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I should've told you<NL>
what I was going to do.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Enough.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Dwelling in the past is futile.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Hey! You don't have<NL>
to say it like that!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
You want to waste time<NL>
listening to her regrets?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You don't have to say it like that.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Our immediate concern<NL>
is [Yuna]'s pilgrimage.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Are you willing to go on?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But then, do you think<NL>
[Yevon2] will allow it?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
The [fayth] are the ones that<NL>
give power to the summoners.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Not the temples or the teachings.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
If the temples try to stop us...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
then we will defy [Yevon2] if we must.<END>

<TEXT>
[Rikku]<NL>
I can't believe you said that!<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Whoa!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Sir [Auron]!?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Count me out.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
But still, we have transgressed<NL>
and must face our punishment.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
We must go to <Cor 88>[Bevelle]<Cor 41>.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
We must speak with Maester Mika<NL>
and explain what has happened.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
There is no other way, I think.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I agree.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sir [Auron]...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
So it is decided.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Will you come with us?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I am the troublemaker, after all.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, that's right!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You can always count on<NL>
[Auron] to complicate things!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Yeah!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Kimahri] roars, and<NL>
[Auron] runs off, and...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I never asked you to follow me.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, but that's<NL>
what friends are for.<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Right?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Yep!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thank you.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Friends, huh?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Man... How can you all<NL>
act like nothing's wrong?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Must got nerves of<NL>
steel or something.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You're too edgy. Listen<NL>
to the hymn and calm down.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Is that coming from the temple?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes, it is [Yevon2]'s gift.<NL>
It soothes the hearts of the faithful.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Who is that singing?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The [fayth]?<NL>
What? It can sing?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Jecht] used to sing this song...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, over and over.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But not this good, that's for sure.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Another trait you share.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What, you were listening?<END>

<TEXT>
[Rikku]<NL>
Hey!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Are you saying<NL>
I'll never be like [Lulu]?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Kimahri]!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We have to atone, to make up<NL>
for the sins we have committed.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Of course...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
it's not like I ever liked<NL>
Maester [Seymor], ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
No way I'll ever forgive him<NL>
for killing Lord [Jyscal]...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
and for trying to do us<NL>
all in too, you know?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But still, the bunch of us<NL>
going against [Yevon2]?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
No way!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm sure that [Maester Mika]<NL>
will listen to us.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Wonder what the<NL>
[Aurochs] are doing now.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Say, you feel something<NL>
weird in the air?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Some kind of bad vibes or something.<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Yeah!<NL>
<CHOICE2>Nope.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I thought so.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Oh? Maybe I'm coming<NL>
down with something.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I really feel weird.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
No sign of enemy.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Yuna] will wake soon.<NL>
[Kimahri] knows this.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] feel no danger.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
This place smell different now.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] not know<NL>
if this good or bad.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
What now, I wonder.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
A lecture?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
You should place<NL>
trust in your friends.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
But you can't expect someone<NL>
to protect you all the time.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
You would do well<NL>
to remember that.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It's advice.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
The Hymn, hmm...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Young summoners are<NL>
magnets for trouble.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
We're under the lake ice, aren't we?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Maybe.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Who knows?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Look. That's the<NL>
bottom of the temple.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
We've fallen a long way.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
So now we're the traitors<NL>
that killed a maester.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The [fayth].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Of course it can.<NL>
Don't be a fool.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Say, isn't the ground shaking?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Heh heh. Friends, huh?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
First time a non-[Al Bhed]<NL>
called me that.<END>
