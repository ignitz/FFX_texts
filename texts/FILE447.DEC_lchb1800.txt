<END>

<NL>
Is it true that the temple and<NL>
the Al Bhed have joined forces<NL>
to fight Sin using a flying ship?<END>

<NL>
I'm glad the Crusaders are in high<NL>
spirits, but I'm just worried they'll<NL>
come up with another reckless plan.<END>

<NL>
During the battle, we could hear the<NL>
roaring of the guns all the way to Luca...<END>

<NL>
We gave up serving the temple.<NL>
It wasn't our choice.<END>

<NL>
I just want to sell off this sweaty armor,<NL>
and start a new life here in Luca.<END>

<NL>
Having that airship would make travelling<NL>
between Luca and Kilika a lot easier...<END>

<NL>
We can finally make it back to Kilika,<NL>
now that the ferries are running again.<END>

<NL>
I just wish the summoners<NL>
would end this, already.<END>

<NL>
Sin hasn't attacked lately.<NL>
That's making me even more nervous.<END>

<NL>
I knew the Crusaders wouldn't win.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s are blustering on about<NL>
destroying [Sin], but, heh... I doubt they will.<END>

<NL>
I hear there's going to be another blitz<NL>
tournament, to commemorate the Calm!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If I reserve a bunch of tickets now,<NL>
I can make a killing!<END>

<NL>
Say, you're that blitzer, right?<NL>
I expect great things from you<NL>
at the next tournament!<END>

<NL>
The city of Luca keeps on blitzin', even<NL>
with all the turmoil goin' on these days.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Even the faltering of the Yevon temple<NL>
won't change that.<END>

<NL>
Even if Sin were to attack today,<NL>
the people of Luca would probably be<NL>
more interested in tomorrow's match.<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks want it all!<NL>
They're asking for VIP seats in the stadium now.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Who do they think they are, anyway?<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks better watch their<NL>
step. What goes around comes around!<END>

<NL>
Fiend attack? So what!<NL>
Big deal.<END>

<NL>
Everyone'll soon forget about it and<NL>
occupy themselves with blitzball.<END>

<NL>
Can't wait till next year's tournament.<END>

<NL>
Tch! Everyone went to go<NL>
see the opening ceremony.<END>

<NL>
Hey, ain't ya a blitzer?<NL>
What are ya doin' walkin' around?<END>

<NL>
What happened to that young lady<NL>
you were with?<END>

<NL>
Heh. She dumped ya, eh?<NL>
Don't let it get ya down.<END>

<NL>
Hey, kiddo, got an extra ticket?<NL>
I'll buy it off you!<END>

<NL>
Or how about I sell ya front row tickets<NL>
for you and the young lady?<END>

<NL>
Huh? You're a blitzer, ain'tcha?<NL>
Guess ya don't need tickets.<END>

<NL>
Get your front row tickets here!<NL>
Sell your unwanted tickets here!<END>

<NL>
I am reporting to you live,<NL>
from outside Luca Stadium.<END>

<NL>
The excitement here has reached<NL>
a feverish pitch as the opening<NL>
ceremony gets under way... H-Hey!<END>

<NL>
I'm in the middle of a broadcast!<NL>
Leave me alone!<END>

Cannot release that player.<END>

<NL>
Many have disdained and shunned the<NL>
Al Bhed and their machina for years, but...<END>

<NL>
As I speak, a flying ship, apparently<NL>
one of those very machina, has<NL>
cornered Sin in its tracks.<END>

<NL>
It may be time for the people of Spira<NL>
to question precepts that have stood<NL>
for a thousand years.<END>

<NL>
However, the Yevon temple has kept its silence<NL>
ever since Grand Maester Mika's death, and...<NL>
Enough already!<END>

<NL>
In Spira's long history, this could<NL>
be the biggest news to ever--<NL>
Move! Now!<END>

<NL>
Even as faith in the Yevon clergy dwindles,<NL>
the temple remains silent, choosing not to<NL>
issue any official statement on the matter.<END>

<NL>
Many are protesting the cold and<NL>
insensitive manner in which the<NL>
temple has treated the people.<END>

<NL>
There have even been reports of a mass exodus<NL>
from Bevelle by dejected temple followers...<NL>
Wh-What do you think you're doing!?<END>

<NL>
Can't you see I'm working here?<NL>
You sure are a show-off, aren't you!<END>

<NL>
As you all know, Operation Mi'ihen<NL>
ended in utter failure.<END>

<NL>
With the Crusaders annihilated, the warrior<NL>
monks and the Guado have been assigned to<NL>
take up security posts in various locales.<END>

<NL>
This dispatch was ordered by Maester<NL>
Kinoc and Maester Seymour as they...<NL>
H-Hey!<END>

<NL>
Would you stop interrupting my broadcast?<NL>
You get enough attention already!<END>

<NL>
Do you know anything about the<NL>
fiends inside the stadium?<END>

<NL>
We have so few facts, we can't<NL>
write up a feature on it yet.<END>

<NL>
Hm? You want me to interview you?<END>

<NL>
It's not like the [Aurochs] are going<NL>
to make it past the first round anyway.<END>

<NL>
Why bother with an interview when<NL>
we already know the outcome?<END>

<NL>
The people of Spira are holding their breaths<NL>
as the flying ship begins its attack on...<NL>
Move it!<END>

<NL>
We have unconfirmed reports that<NL>
Maester Seymour has committed an<NL>
unspeakable crime... Will you move!?<END>

<NL>
The mysterious disappearance of the summoners<NL>
may somehow be connected to the Al Bhe...<NL>
Ahh! Just let me do my job!<END>

<NL>
I've been interviewing eyewitnesses,<NL>
but nobody seems to know a thing.<END>

<NL>
Well... If you win at least one<NL>
game, I'll grant you an interview.<END>

<NL>
Oh yes, congratulations!<NL>
I have a lot more respect<NL>
for the [Aurochs] now.<END>

<NL>
Did our Hymn of the Fayth<NL>
reach the flying ship?<END>

<NL>
The temple is in a state of chaos, but we must<NL>
remain strong and keep faith in the teachings<NL>
as we wait for the Calm.<END>

<NL>
I pray that the fallen Crusaders may<NL>
rest peacefully on the Farplane.<END>

<NL>
The power of [Master Seymor]'s aeon<NL>
was just incredible.<END>

<NL>
I can see why he was appointed a<NL>
maester at such a young age.<END>

<NL>
A lady summoner?<NL>
Sorry, haven't seen her.<END>

<NL>
Even if she did pass by, I<NL>
probably wouldn't have noticed,<NL>
what with the huge crowd and all.<END>

<NL>
By the way, I did hear<NL>
someone whistling, though...<END>

<NL>
I really don't care which team<NL>
wins or loses.<END>

<NL>
I just want to watch the game<NL>
and go crazy.<END>

<NL>
I never imagined the Calm would<NL>
come during my lifetime.<END>

<NL>
I hear the mood in Guadosalam is<NL>
just as gloomy as the Farplane.<END>

<NL>
Even if the Crusaders are wiped out,<NL>
the warrior monks will protect us.<END>

<NL>
The <Cor 88>Sphere Theater<Cor 41> is up ahead.<END>

<NL>
Please enjoy revisiting all the<NL>
wondrous sights and sounds you've<NL>
encountered along your journey.<END>

<NL>
The temple's probably devising a grand plan.<NL>
That's why they're not doing anything right now.<END>

<NL>
We'll be okay as long as the<NL>
warrior monks protect us.<END>

<NL>
I hope those fiends aren't a<NL>
harbinger of [Sin]'s coming.<END>

<NL>
How can you not be excited when the<NL>
tournament's about to start soon!<END>

<NL>
I'm sure the people of Kilika were<NL>
singing, too. I'm sure of it.<END>

<NL>
I'm just worried that Sin<NL>
might attack Kilika again.<END>

<NL>
The Kilika Beasts went back home.<NL>
I hope they win next year.<END>

<NL>
The [Kilika Beasts] couldn't play up<NL>
to their potential this year.<END>

<NL>
Can't blame 'em, though. Their island was<NL>
recently attacked by [Sin], after all.<END>

<NL>
Our family has supported the [Kilika Beasts]<NL>
ever since my great grandfather's day.<END>

<NL>
Let us pray that Yevon will be<NL>
watching over the flying ship.<END>

<NL>
Some of Luca's residents are making<NL>
light of the teachings. What sacrilege.<END>

<NL>
I shall remain in Luca for a while<NL>
and spread the word of Yevon<NL>
among the citizens.<END>

<NL>
Glory be to [Master Seymor]'s aeon,<NL>
for keeping the destruction to a minimum.<END>

<NL>
A blessing from [Yevon2], indeed.<END>

<NL>
The people are indulging in merrymaking,<NL>
but we must keep in mind that...<END>

<NL>
I will spare you the lecture.<END>

<NL>
We should make a whole bunch of those<NL>
flying ships and deliver an all-out attack!<END>

<NL>
I saw a flying ship at dock number 1.<NL>
Think that's gonna beat Sin?<END>

<NL>
It's too bad about the Crusaders...<NL>
I thought for sure their plan would work.<END>

<NL>
I can't believe fiends would attack<NL>
right in front of the maester, of all people.<END>

<NL>
Just goes to show you there is absolutely<NL>
no safe haven in [Spira].<END>

<NL>
Have you seen a little boy?<NL>
My son and I got separated in the crowd.<END>

<NL>
I told him to whistle<NL>
if he ever got lost...<END>

<NL>
The Calm shall infuse new light and<NL>
energy into the temple once again.<END>

<NL>
The Macalania temple is losing its faith.<NL>
I do not wish to live there anymore.<END>

<NL>
The Crusaders defied the precepts and failed.<NL>
They should disband for their own good.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s are devising<NL>
a sacrilegious operation.<END>

<NL>
I hear they may be collaborating<NL>
with the [Al Bhed].<END>

<NL>
You think I stand out in this temple attire?<NL>
Perhaps I should change?<END>

<NL>
The machina and the Hymn may weaken Sin,<NL>
but only a summoner can finish it off.<END>

<NL>
Those warrior monks were useless.<NL>
They didn't do a thing.<END>

<NL>
I think the fiend incident was the Al Bhed's doing.<NL>
They're always up to no good.<END>

<NL>
Up until last year, it was the [Crusader]s<NL>
who were in charge of security.<END>

<NL>
If they had been here this year, the<NL>
fiends would never have appeared.<END>

<NL>
Don't you think it's disrespectful of<NL>
the [Al Bhed2] to play in the Yevon Cup?<END>

<NL>
The flying ship is a forbidden machina, but<NL>
we should just get it approved by the temple.<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks came in as reinforcements<NL>
soon after the Crusaders were defeated.<NL>
It was as if they knew the operation would fail.<END>

<NL>
My buddy's in critical condition after<NL>
being attacked by a fiend. Damn it!<END>

<NL>
I feel bad for the [Crusader]s.<NL>
They can't even stick around and watch<NL>
the game because of the operation.<END>

<NL>
I hear the warrior monks invaded Besaid.<NL>
They were looking for some traitors.<END>

<NL>
The Aurochs are a completely new team!<NL>
They finally have some offense because of you!<END>

<NL>
This is the first time I've ever<NL>
seen the [Aurochs] win!<END>

<NL>
You're that newbie from the [Aurochs], right?<NL>
Good luck to you!<END>

<NL>
The only thing the people can really<NL>
do is to pray for the Calm.<END>

<NL>
Why use machina, when we have summoners?<END>

<NL>
The [Aurochs] really improved this year, but their<NL>
success was overshadowed by the fiend incident.<END>

<NL>
Hey, did you see the lady summoner?<NL>
What was she like?<END>

<NL>
You! You're that traitor!<END>

<NL>
Let him go. Even the two of us<NL>
won't be able to overpower him.<END>

<NL>
But, what about our duties<NL>
to the temple?<END>

<NL>
Our duties? We missed the ship to Bevelle!<NL>
They're not coming back for us!<NL>
We're nothing now!<END>

<NL>
You'd probably kick my butt, anyway.<END>

<NL>
We wear the armor of the temple,<NL>
but it doesn't mean a thing.<END>

<NL>
So, how did those fiends<NL>
break into the stadium?<END>

<NL>
The authorities have no idea.<NL>
They can only assume they just<NL>
popped out of nowhere.<END>

<NL>
I'm keeping a close eye on the<NL>
[Al Bhed Psyches] this year.<END>

<NL>
Ewww... Why would you root for the<NL>
[Al Bhed2]? You really do have bad taste.<END>

<NL>
I like how they cover up their faces.<NL>
It's just so sexy and mysterious.<END>

<NL>
Who knows what would have happened<NL>
if Maester [Seymor] hadn't been there...<END>

<NL>
[Master Seymor] is our saviour.<END>

<NL>
Well, I would have to say it's<NL>
the [Ronso Fangs] for me.<END>

<NL>
The [Ronso2]?<NL>
They're just a bunch of meatheads!<END>

<NL>
And that's why the other teams<NL>
are dead meat!<END>

<NL>
I was really surprised by the<NL>
sudden fiend attack, but you<NL>
know what shocked me the most?<END>

<NL>
Oh, the [Aurochs] winning the tournament,<NL>
right? Yeah, I still can't believe it.<END>

<NL>
What? The [Besaid Aurochs]?<END>

<NL>
Oh, come on. Seriously?<END>

<NL>
What do you say we ditch guard<NL>
duty and go have some fun?<END>

<NL>
H-How can you propose such<NL>
a thing? As warriors of Yevon,<NL>
we have duties to uphold!<END>

<NL>
Hmph! That's the problem with you<NL>
temple types. You're too square!<END>

<NL>
But, you serve the temple, too.<END>

<NL>
We're in sunny Luca now, so<NL>
you should all just loosen up!<END>

<NL>
The [Aurochs] won the tournament.<NL>
It must be some kind of mistake.<END>

<NL>
I agree! The authorities should<NL>
drop the fiend investigation<NL>
and look into this first!<END>

<NL>
I'm glad the Goers won, but<NL>
I don't feel like celebrating.<END>

<NL>
Yeah, those fiends really ruined<NL>
the whole blitz experience.<END>

<NL>
I wonder how it'll turn out this year?<END>

<NL>
Well, duh!<NL>
Of course the Goers are gonna win.<END>

<NL>
Psshhh! I know that! What I mean is,<NL>
how many goals will Bickson score?<END>

<NL>
Yeah, Bickson's gonna lead the<NL>
Goers to victory as usual.<END>

<NL>
But you know, Graav's<NL>
been doin' well lately.<NL>
Maybe he'll be the tournament MVP.<END>

<NL>
No way! I'm cheering for<NL>
Bickson all the way! He is<NL>
and will always be number one.<END>

<NL>
Oh, yeah? Well, my sister's friend's<NL>
boyfriend is Graav's cousin!<END>

<NL>
Well, I know a guy who's best friends<NL>
with Bickson's younger brother!<END>

<NL>
Once the Calm comes, I'm planning to travel all<NL>
through Spira to film the joyous occasion.<END>

<NL>
If you want to be interviewed, show<NL>
us your most outrageous gag, okay?<END>

<NL>
Stop bothering us! You've already proven<NL>
your point at the tournament!<END>

<NL>
Hey, congratulations!<NL>
I got everything on sphere.<END>

<NL>
Never in my wildest dreams did I think<NL>
the [Besaid Aurochs] would win the cup.<END>

<NL>
Sorry, but we're broadcasting<NL>
the news about the fiend attack.<END>

<NL>
Hey, well if it isn't the [Aurochs] comedian.<NL>
Thanks for that comic relief!<END>

<NL>
Keep up the antics throughout the tournament.<NL>
I'll be sure to capture you on sphere.<END>

<NL>
The opening ceremony's about to begin.<NL>
Shouldn't you be heading back?<END>

<NL>
Is it true that the ferry is out of service?<END>

<NL>
I hear [Sin] may still be lurking<NL>
in the sea nearby.<END>

<NL>
At this rate, who knows when<NL>
we'll make it back to [Kilika]?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm sorry, please let me through.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Hey, let's go.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You're really famous.<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I hope we don't get separated.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna]!<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What was that?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
In [Zanarkand], we do this<NL>
to cheer on blitz players.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's not working.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Practice!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Okay.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, use that if we get separated.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Then, I'll come running, okay?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, guess we should just<NL>
stick together, then,<NL>
till you can do it.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes, sir!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You try it, too! Put your fingers<NL>
in your mouth like this.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Like...this?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh-uh, not like that.<NL>
Like this.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Then, you just blow.<END>
