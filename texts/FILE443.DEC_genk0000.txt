<NL>
We've always fought side by side.<NL>
Now we go back home together.<END>

<NL>
We're leaving the [Crusader]s.<NL>
Why fight? We know we can't win.<END>

<NL>
It's not much of a wound... I should<NL>
be able to go on...but I can't.<END>

<NL>
The mission fails. I can't even<NL>
walk... What did I do to deserve this?<END>

<NL>
[Al Bhed] might come and try to<NL>
disrupt Lord [Seymor]'s wedding.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I assure you, those ruffians will<NL>
never set foot in [Guadosalam]!<END>

<NL>
After she is wed, we [Guado]<NL>
will protect Lady [Yuna].<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Good day, everyone.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
We can all learn a lesson from <NL>
what has happened to the [Crusader]s.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Only the truly faithful have<NL>
a hope of defeating [Sin].<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I'm thinking of going to<NL>
[Guadosalam].<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I have not spoken with<NL>
the [Guado] for some time.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Lady Summoner, good fortune<NL>
to you and your guardians.<END>

[Biran]<NL>
Look! One of [Kimahri]'s friends.<NL>
Looks just like him.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What?<END>

[Biran]<NL>
Both follow summoners on all fours!<NL>
Hornless goatlings!<END>

[Yenke]<NL>
Hornless! Hornless!<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
You come to insult [Kimahri]?<END>

[Biran]<NL>
Wrong.<NL>
We come to warn little [Kimahri].<END>

[Yenke]<NL>
Summoners disappear. Never return.<END>

[Biran]<NL>
Next will be [Kimahri]'s summoner.<END>

[Yenke]<NL>
Poor [Kimahri]!<NL>
Lost his horn, next lose his summoner!<END>

[Biran]<NL>
Pitiful [Kimahri]!<NL>
Howl alone! Howl alone!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Do those two got<NL>
something against you?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What, they were just picking on you?<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] will deal with them.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And I'll help!<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] alone.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It's [Kimahri]'s problem.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We can't interfere; it's a rule.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I'm worried.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Let the [Ronso] deal with<NL>
[Ronso] problems, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
That's how it's always been.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I mean I'm worried about<NL>
those summoners disappearing.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
They aren't just<NL>
disappearing into thin air.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, if we guardians do our job...<NL>
no problem, right?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Whoa!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Confident.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah!<END>

<NL>
The summoner [Yuna] and her party.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How'd you know?<END>

<NL>
You're famous.<END>

<NL>
The daughter of a famous summoner,<NL>
helping those who defy [Yevon2]?<END>

<NL>
No two summoners are alike,<NL>
but you're something else!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You are a summoner, too?<END>

<NL>
The name's [Belgemine].<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Well, [Yuna].<NL>
I think fate has brought us together.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Shall we make the best of it, then?<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
A contest of aeons.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
It would be a good chance<NL>
for you to hone your skills.<NL>
That is, if you wish to.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
We meet again.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I heard you took part<NL>
in [Operation Mi'ihen].<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
You've seen that<NL>
machina aren't the answer.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
In the end, only summoners<NL>
can hope to defeat [Sin].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You are right. I must train harder.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I can help with that, if you like.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I propose a contest of aeons.<NL>
A friendly contest, of course.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
As you wish.<NL>
A pity, though.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I'm ready anytime,<NL>
if you change your mind.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm ready.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
That's the spirit!<NL>
But before we begin...<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I have healed your aeons.<NL>
Well, shall we?<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
You're good.<NL>
You bested me fairly.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Here, your prize.<NL>
Go on, take it.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I look forward to meeting you again.<NL>
Till next time, [Yuna].<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Still wet behind the ears,<NL>
but you have spirit.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Study, [Yuna], and grow strong.<END>
