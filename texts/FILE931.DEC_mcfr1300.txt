I tell you, this place hasn't<NL>
changed a bit since we were young.<END>

<NL>
How long has it been<NL>
since I married you, eh?<END>

<NL>
It's a wonder that we're still<NL>
alive after all [Sin]'s put<NL>
us through.<END>

<NL>
Well, it hasn't changed since<NL>
before we were even born.<END>

<NL>
Well, let's see...<NL>
I still remember it like it was only yesterday.<END>

<NL>
This is truly [Yevon2]'s<NL>
blessing, grandpa.<END>

<NL>
I'm supposed to meet my family here,<NL>
but they're nowhere in sight.<END>

<NL>
I wonder if they got the place<NL>
mixed up. They're careless sometimes.<END>

<NL>
What? Really?<NL>
Thanks, kid!<END>

<NL>
I feel so relaxed when I'm<NL>
looking at this spring.<END>

<NL>
It's quiet enough to<NL>
forget about [Sin].<END>

<NL>
Me too.<NL>
How strange it is.<END>

<NL>
You're so carefree,<NL>
aren't you? I envy you.<END>
