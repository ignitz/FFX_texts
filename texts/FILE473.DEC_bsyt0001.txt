<NL>
It was then, standing in that place.<END>

<NL>
I began to realize how different<NL>
this world was from my own.<END>

<NL>
Ten years have passed since<NL>
Lord [Braska] became high summoner.<END>

<NL>
And finally we receive<NL>
a statue for our temple.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's a high summoner?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I...I got too close to [Sin]'s, uh, toxin.<END>

<NL>
It was funny hearing myself make<NL>
the same excuse over and over.<NL>
Funny, and a little sad.<END>

<NL>
The summoners are practitioners<NL>
of a sacred art, sworn to protect<NL>
the people of [Yevon2].<END>

<NL>
Only a chosen few become summoners,<NL>
who call forth entities of great power:<NL>
the aeons.<END>

<NL>
The aeons hear our prayers<NL>
and come down to us.<NL>
They are the blessing of [Yevon2].<END>

<NL>
So what he meant...<END>

<NL>
was that we should respect some kinda<NL>
great men or something like that...<NL>
I figured.<END>

<NL>
Only sworn guardians may<NL>
approach the Cloister of Trials.<END>

<NL>
Pray hard, and the toxin will<NL>
surely release its grip on you.<END>

<NL>
The high summoners, in order from the<NL>
right: Lord [Braska], Lady Yocun...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Lord Ohalland, and Lord Gandof.<NL>
Do you remember them now?<END>

<NL>
[High Summoner Gandof], give us your<NL>
blessing, and watch over my family.<END>

<NL>
The village was attacked by [Sin]<NL>
when I was just a little kid, ya?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
The village was burnt to ashes.<NL>
I still have nightmares of that day.<END>

<NL>
Don't bother people when they're<NL>
praying! It's against the teachings!<END>

<NL>
May the apprentice summoner<NL>
return to us safely.<END>

<NL>
I am sure that Lord [Braska] is<NL>
watching over our apprentice summoner.<END>

<NL>
Me favorite's Lord Ohalland, ya?<NL>
Spitting image of me old hubby.<END>
