[Dona]<NL>
Look, I'm really tired.<NL>
Leave me.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
If it's not an emergency,<NL>
would you mind leaving?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Okay.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Wait... There's something<NL>
I want to ask you.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
What would you think if I said<NL>
I...I was giving up my pilgrimage?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Sure! Sounds good to me.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Who cares?<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Unusual.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Most people would never<NL>
forgive a summoner who quit.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why's that?<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Behind my back, they would<NL>
say I was abandoning my duty.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, who cares?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why not do your own thing and<NL>
let them say what they want!<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Easy for you to say.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
But...you do have a point.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Maybe [Barthello] and I should<NL>
go someplace far away.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Show some sympathy!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, like all the sympathy you<NL>
showed me first time we met?<END>

[Dona]<NL>
You're right.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Quitting now would be<NL>
sort of anti-climactic, no?<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Tell [Yuna] something, would you?<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Tell her she still has a rival: me!<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Tell her she'd better<NL>
do her best, or be bested.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
You'll tell her, won't you?<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Thanks for the company.<NL>
I feel so much better now.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
It's too cramped<NL>
to call aeons here.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
I'll leave this fight to you.<NL>
Show us your stuff!<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
We'll leave the other<NL>
compartments to you.<END>

<NL>
Years of sweat and toil to build<NL>
it, and now [Home] is rubble!<END>

<NL>
Come, [Guado]! I challenge you!<NL>
I will fight till you are all dust!<END>

<NL>
I must tell the other players<NL>
in [Luca] what has happened!<END>

<NL>
My friends, they died protecting<NL>
[summoner]. I will do the same.<END>

<NL>
We don't know how [Sin] will react.<END>

<NL>
If you are prepared, we can<NL>
attack [Sin] at any time!<END>

<NL>
The gravity, it bends!<NL>
And with [Sin] at the center!<END>

<NL>
[Sin] is still living.<NL>
How will we stop it?<END>

<NL>
You attack from the front?<NL>
It is a crazy, but delightful plan!<END>

<NL>
Let us destroy [Sin]<NL>
once and for all!<END>

<NL>
No time for tears and shouting!<NL>
All we must do is rebuild our [Home].<END>

<NL>
Okay, okay!<END>

<NL>
I finally have figured out how<NL>
it is that this ship is moved.<END>

<NL>
When you battle with [Sin]<NL>
I will be singing too, yes!<END>

<NL>
Leave the ship to my hands!<NL>
You go now to the deck!<END>

<NL>
The ship must be tuned to<NL>
be ready for the final fight!<END>

<NL>
Our ship is in top shape!<NL>
Now, go and fell the great [Sin]!<END>

<NL>
The ship is fine, even<NL>
inside [Sin], I think.<END>

<NL>
I hit my head when the ship shook.<NL>
Now I have a lump!<END>

<NL>
Not scared, not scared!<NL>
Not scared, not scared!<END>

<NL>
When will we go [Home]?<END>

<NL>
Even without our [Home], we must<NL>
live on! I only hope I am able.<END>

<NL>
The corridor is protected by [summoner].<NL>
So this room should be safe!<END>

<NL>
We left kids on the ground.<NL>
Safer for them.<END>

<NL>
I am glad you made it back from [Bevelle].<NL>
They didn't welcome us last time.<END>

<NL>
I will sing here too!<NL>
Good luck!<END>

<NL>
I wish to be done with battle,<NL>
to see my little brother again!<END>

<NL>
Do not be lazy!<NL>
[Sin] is right before us!<END>

<NL>
Once the [Calm] comes,<NL>
[Home] must be rebuilt.<END>

<NL>
Poor child, he does not understand<NL>
that our [Home] is no more.<END>

<NL>
Chased by [fiend]! We are all<NL>
very tired, and very scared.<END>

<NL>
It pains me most to see<NL>
the children so scared.<END>

<NL>
The [summoner] and [guardian]<NL>
seem full of worry.<END>

<NL>
I can use a weapon!<NL>
I will show them how [Al Bhed] fight!<END>

<NL>
These things here belong to Mister [Rin].<NL>
They are not yours to take!<END>

<NL>
There is much to buy,<NL>
so do not be shy!<END>

<NL>
Do you have all that you need?<NL>
Talk to Mister [Rin]!<END>

<NL>
We must repair the damaged ship.<NL>
But have we the parts?<END>

<NL>
It will be a battle most violent!<NL>
Check that you have all you need!<END>

<NL>
All that is here is at your<NL>
disposal! Be prepared!<END>
