<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Maybe next time.<NL>
<CHOICE2>I'd love to hear.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Hmph. Suit yourself.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
There is a legend, you know.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Just before the horrible<NL>
[Sin] appeared...<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
a terrible war raged between<NL>
[Bevelle] and [Zanarkand].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
When the armies of [Bevelle] attacked<NL>
Mount Gagazet, they heard a song<NL>
echoing across the snowy slopes.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
"'Tis a song from an otherworld," they<NL>
said. The soldiers panicked and ran.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And then, as if to pursue the<NL>
retreating armies, [Sin] appeared!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Some time later, scouts from<NL>
[Bevelle] braved the mountain.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
On the other side, they witnessed<NL>
the ruins that had been [Zanarkand].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
The city destroyed. Not a<NL>
single soul left standing. Gone!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
In its place, a multitude of the<NL>
[fayth] had gathered on Gagazet.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
They were singing a song.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
It's the song we now call<NL>
the "Hymn of the Fayth."<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And that, as they say, is that.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Well...maybe not all of it.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Would you like to hear the rest?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Maybe next time.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Let's continue.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Rumors flew in [Bevelle] about<NL>
[Sin]'s sudden appearance.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
They said that the people of<NL>
[Zanarkand] became the [fayth],<NL>
that they had called [Sin].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And that the man responsible...<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
was none other than the summoner<NL>
[Yevon2], ruler of [Zanarkand]! <END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Yes, the lord father of Lady Yunalesca.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
On the eve of [Zanarkand]'s<NL>
destruction, Lady Yunalesca...<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
had fled to safety<NL>
with her husband, [Zaon].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Later, the two used the<NL>
Final Summoning to defeat [Sin].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Yet the people of [Bevelle]<NL>
still feared Yu [Yevon2].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
It was to quell his wrath<NL>
that they revered him, and<NL>
first spread his teachings.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And so were born<NL>
the temples of [Yevon2].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
I suppose it's possible<NL>
Yunalesca had planned it<NL>
that way from the start!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
A fair trade, she defeats<NL>
[Sin] in exchange for her<NL>
lord father's honor.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Of course, there's no proof.<NL>
No, the facts are lost<NL>
in the mists of time.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And who'd admit [Yevon2] was<NL>
an enemy of [Bevelle]?<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
You can bet the temples had a<NL>
hand in covering that one up!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And that, as they say, is that.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Let me tell you about<NL>
the Hymn of the Fayth.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
It was once a [Zanarkand] song,<NL>
sung in defiance of [Bevelle]!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Of course, the [Yevon2] clergy<NL>
of [Bevelle] forbade it.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Then, as these things often go, those<NL>
who disliked [Yevon2] began to sing it.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
The [Al Bhed], for instance.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
The Hymn of the Fayth became<NL>
the symbol of defiance against [Yevon2].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
[Yevon2] could do<NL>
nothing but capitulate.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
They lifted the ban on the song,<NL>
and spread a new story.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
They said the hymn was a song<NL>
sung to soothe the souls of the dead.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And so saying, they took the song<NL>
and made it scripture.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
That's why today, the hymn<NL>
is sung all over [Spira].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
You could say that, though<NL>
[Zanarkand] is gone from this<NL>
world, it lives on in the song.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Aaaah, but look at the time.<NL>
I've rambled on again.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
I do love stories, you see.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Well, I owe you my gratitude<NL>
for hearing this old scholar out.<END>

Somewhere, ya? Yeah,<NL>

Look, I couldn't care<NL>

Because you are not of this world.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
To those who truly believe<NL>
