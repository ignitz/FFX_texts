Word has gotten around about me.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Now all the [Crusader]s<NL>
are ignoring me!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Thank you so much<NL>
for your words yesterday.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
A safe journey to you!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Would you like to<NL>
hear about the Highroad?<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Hmm...pity.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
We are currently travelling a part of the<NL>
[Mi'ihen] Highroad called the Newroad.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Naturally, that suggests that<NL>
there is, or was, an Oldroad.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
The road that runs below this Newroad<NL>
is the original [Mi'ihen] Highroad.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Hence, the road that Lord [Mi'ihen]<NL>
walked is not this road, but the Oldroad.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
The Newroad was built to<NL>
replace the Oldroad destroyed<NL>
by [Sin] five hundred years ago.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
But sometimes, standing on the<NL>
Oldroad and reminiscing about the past<NL>
can be a pleasurable pastime.<END>

<NL>
The road's finally opened, so<NL>
I'm planning on heading north.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Actually, I'm kinda scared about going.<NL>
A lot of people died there.<END>

<NL>
I'll bet the dead soldiers became fiends,<NL>
and are creeping around.<END>

<NL>
There are some [Al Bhed] wandering around.<NL>
What are they up to now?<END>

<NL>
The [Al Bhed] wouldn't be acting so big<NL>
if the warrior monks were here.<END>

<NL>
That ship is an [Al Bhed2] machina, right?<NL>
I can't believe the clergy's relying on it.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
If the temples were to disappear,<NL>
what would we pray to?<END>

<NL>
We live in the desert, so<NL>
I have never seen so many flowers.<END>

<NL>
I like the flower here and the flower<NL>
in the desert. I like them both.<END>

<NL>
My dad is riding on an [airship].<END>

<NL>
I sang out loud so that Dad can hear me.<END>
