The wind...it's nice.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You're a [blitzball] player, aren't you?<NL>
From [Zanarkand], right?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You hear that from [Wakka]?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Wakka] doesn't believe me at all.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I've heard, in [Zanarkand]...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
there is a great stadium,<NL>
all lit up even at night!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
A man named [Jecht] told me.<NL>
He was my father's guardian.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
My father...his name is [Jecht]!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Amazing!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You know, our meeting like this<NL>
must be the blessing of [Yevon2]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
My old man, he died. Ten years ago,<NL>
off the coast of [Zanarkand].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
He went out to sea for training<NL>
one day...and never came back.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And no one's seen him since then.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I remember,<NL>
that was the day my father left.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The date fits, doesn't it?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You're here, are you not?<END>

<NL>
Sin!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What do you think you're doing?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Stick a harpoon in him<NL>
and we'll all get dragged under!<END>

<NL>
[Sin] is going for [Kilika]!<NL>
We gotta distract it!<END>

<NL>
Our families are in [Kilika]!<NL>
Forgive us, Lady Summoner!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Wait!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Oh, boy...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But I believe you!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Great [blitzball] tournaments are held<NL>
there, and the stands are always full!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How do you know that?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sounds like him,<NL>
but it can't be him.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Why not?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Why, that's the day that<NL>
[Jecht] came to [Spira].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's true! I first met [Jecht]<NL>
ten years and three months ago!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, but how would he get here?<END>
