<NL>
I'm supposed to meet my family here,<NL>
but they're nowhere in sight.<END>

<NL>
I wonder if they got the place mixed up.<NL>
They're so careless sometimes.<END>

<NL>
What? Really?<NL>
Thanks, kid!<END>

<NL>
Please, I need my rest.<NL>
This long trip has tired me.<END>

<NL>
Hey, aren't you one of<NL>
the [Besaid Aurochs]?<END>

<NL>
You are a blitzball player?<NL>
There is something I must tell you.<END>

<NL>
I'd like to apologize<NL>
on behalf of the [Guado].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We are responsible for the fiends<NL>
that attacked the stadium after the game.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We're sorry for the disturbance<NL>
and for disrupting such a wonderful<NL>
game. Please accept our apologies.<END>

<NL>
It was Maester [Seymor]'s plan<NL>
to release the fiends in [Luca Stadium].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He thought he could win the trust<NL>
of the people by defeating the<NL>
fiends with his aeon.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I heard that his plan to marry the<NL>
high summoner's daughter was solely to<NL>
gain the support of the people of [Yevon2].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
There seem to have been other reasons as<NL>
well, but now, we will never know.<END>

<NL>
By obeying Maester [Seymor],<NL>
we [Guado] have committed an<NL>
inexcusable crime.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's far too late to try shifting<NL>
the blame to Maester [Seymor].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Within time, the [Guado] will<NL>
be as despised as the [Al Bhed].<END>

<NL>
That child's brother was Maester<NL>
[Seymor]'s subordinate.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He died while invading the [Al Bhed]<NL>
hideout, searching for the lost summoners.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He was never sent...<NL>
I fear he now wanders as a fiend.<END>

<NL>
The power of the [Guado] has greatly<NL>
deteriorated. They merely await the<NL>
inevitable, now.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
That is why I brought that child<NL>
and moved away from [Guadosalam].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Perhaps we will find peace<NL>
in some far away land.<END>

<NL>
I still haven't told that child<NL>
the truth about the [Guado].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Perhaps when he grows older and<NL>
can accept the reality of the situation...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
only then will I reveal the<NL>
truth about everything to him.<END>

<NL>
I'm tired now after talking so long.<NL>
I'm not as young as I used to be.<END>

<NL>
Grandma says she has something<NL>
important to tell you.<END>

<NL>
My brother died fighting the bad guys.<NL>
He's a real hero!<END>

<NL>
[Guadosalam]'s no fun these days.<NL>
Everyone's so sad there.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
That's why I'm going on a journey<NL>
with my grandmother.<END>

<NL>
We're going to rest here<NL>
until grandma feels better.<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>They were waiting over there.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Hope you find 'em.<END>
