[Maechen]<NL>
Would you like to hear a bit<NL>
about the wondrous shoopuf?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>No stories, please!<NL>
<CHOICE2>Absolutely!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Perhaps you'd like to hear<NL>
a bit about the Hypello, hmm?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Got any weapons?<NL>
<CHOICE2>Got any items?<NL>
<CHOICE3>Leave.<END>

<NL>
Thanks!<END>

<NL>
Aww, leaving already?<NL>
Well, come back again, you hear?<END>

<NL>
There's a long wait to ride the<NL>
shoopuf since space is limited.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But summoners get priority since they<NL>
need to get on their way to [Zanarkand].<END>

<NL>
Careful where you shop.<NL>
This area is full of cunning merchants.<END>

<NL>
The merchants are ecstatic about<NL>
the maester's marriage plans.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They're boosting profits by taking<NL>
advantage of the people's festive mood.<END>

<NL>
Until recently, these merchants<NL>
only sold to [Crusader]s.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They claimed to be giving the [Crusader]s<NL>
a deal because of [Operation Mi'ihen], but<NL>
they were really just ripping them off.<END>

<NL>
With all the traitors and [Al Bhed] around,<NL>
not many travellers pass through here anymore.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
The merchants are suffering<NL>
with so few customers.<END>

<NL>
They say [Sin] landed in [Bevelle].<NL>
It's better to stay away from the north.<END>

<NL>
Seems the [Guado] won't<NL>
come out of [Guadosalam].<END>

<NL>
I was going to return to [Bevelle]<NL>
after the tournament in [Luca]...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
but the [Crusader]s blocked the<NL>
roads and I couldn't get through. <END>

<NL>
My plans are ruined.<NL>
Now what am I supposed to do?<END>

<NL>
The [Guado] can't stop<NL>
talking about the marriage.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Well, I guess it's not every<NL>
day they hear good news.<END>

<NL>
I want to quit the [Crusader]s<NL>
and settle down in the country.<END>

<NL>
So Lady [Yuna]'s getting married, huh?<NL>
That's great news.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I wish the [Crusader]s had defeated<NL>
[Sin]... That would've been perfect.<END>

<NL>
By the time we get home, they'll<NL>
be celebrating their marriage.<END>

<NL>
Welcome! You seem to<NL>
have fine taste, sir!<END>

<NL>
Listen, buy from me and you won't<NL>
have any problems down the line.<END>

<NL>
Well, hello there.<NL>
Are you in luck today!<END>

<NL>
If you buy something now, I'll give you<NL>
a big discount! Well, what do you say?<END>

Driver<NL>
Noo, I don shink sho.<NL>
Ish bad idea, yesh.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Please, we beg of you!<END>

Driver<NL>
Imposhibibble! Imposhibibble!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's wrong?<END>

[Elma]<NL>
This guy won't let<NL>
our chocobo on the shoopuf!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It is kinda big.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
It's just not fair!<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
He does have a point, though.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
So, what?<NL>
We just leave him behind?<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Hey, I didn't say that. Just...<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
It is no good.<NL>
We will have to find another way.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
We will find a ford<NL>
where we can cross on foot.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Yes, Captain, sir!<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
But...that'll take days!<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Where there's a will, there's a way.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Oh, boy...<END>

[Elma]<NL>
That's our captain!<END>

<NL>
Where there's a will, there's a way.<END>

<NL>
Those words stayed with me.<END>

<NL>
I wonder how Captain<NL>
[Lucil] is doing.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Let the driver know<NL>
when you're ready.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Riding a shoopuf<NL>
isn't THAT much fun.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
How little you know!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Some things little boys<NL>
never grow out of!<END>

[Wakka] & [Tidus]<NL>
Right?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The merchants here are wily.<NL>
Pick your shop well.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Pity.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
There are many things<NL>
we do not know about the shoopuf.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
For example, what does it eat?<NL>
It eats nothing!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
The water it sucks through its shnoz<NL>
somehow supports its considerable size.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Some theorize it eats teeny-weeny<NL>
waterborne organisms.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And that, as they say, is that.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
These shoopuf handlers belong to a race<NL>
of water-dwellers known as the Hypello.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
They may be slow on land, but in<NL>
the water they're quick as silvery fish!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
You'd think they'd make<NL>
admirable players of [blitzball].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
But their lackadaisical disposition<NL>
draws them to less strenuous pastimes.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And that, as they say, is that.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
I believe I've said<NL>
all there is to say.<END>
