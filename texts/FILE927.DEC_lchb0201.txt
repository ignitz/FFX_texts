<NL>
I'll bet you anything the [Luca Goers]<NL>
are gonna win again this year.<END>

<NL>
Maybe so, but you'd better not<NL>
count out the [Kilika Beasts]!<END>

<NL>
The [Besaid Aurochs]? Win?<END>

<NL>
Now that's funny! Hahaha!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Gimme a break, man!<END>

<NL>
We have sealed off all access to<NL>
the stadium for the time being.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We're trying to control the mad rush of<NL>
people who have already entered the stadium.<END>

<NL>
We apologize for the inconvenience, but<NL>
access to the stadium has been sealed off.<END>

<NL>
[Maester Mika2] has ruled Spira<NL>
for the past fifty years.<END>

<NL>
Man, this tournament is gonna rock!<NL>
Even the big man is here to see the game.<END>

<NL>
If I can catch one glimpse of Maester [Mika],<NL>
I'll have something to brag about back home.<END>

<NL>
Maester [Mika] doesn't make many public<NL>
appearances. He's getting too old for that.<END>

<NL>
I'm glad I got here safely.<NL>
Don't want another S.S. Liki incident.<END>

<NL>
Ladies and gentlemen, the day<NL>
we've all been waiting for!<END>

<NL>
The opening tournament<NL>
of the season!<END>

<NL>
This event is sponsored by [Yevon2].<END>

<NL>
And this year we celebrate<NL>
[Maester Mika]'s 50th year in office.<END>

<NL>
Ah, over there!<NL>
The ships carrying the<NL>
players are arriving now!<END>

<NL>
This would be dock number 2.<END>

<NL>
They're a living, breathing,<NL>
statistical impossibility!<NL>
I've never seen a team this bad!<END>

<NL>
That's right!<NL>
In twenty-three years they've<NL>
never made it past the first round!<END>

<NL>
Only a few die-hard fans<NL>
are in the audience today.<END>

<NL>
Best of luck to them, and a<NL>
safe journey back to [Besaid].<END>

<NL>
Right, Jimma.<END>

<NL>
Moving right along,<NL>
our next team is...<END>

<NL>
Here they are, folks!<NL>
Our very own [Luca Goers]!<END>

<NL>
They've got power!<NL>
They've got speed!<NL>
They've got teamwork!<END>

<NL>
They're an all-around first-class team!<NL>
And they're back home in Luca!<END>

<NL>
Without a doubt, they are<NL>
the favorite this year, Bobba.<END>

<NL>
And after the way they dominated<NL>
last year, it'd take a miracle<NL>
for them to lose today.<END>

<NL>
You can say that again, Jimma.<NL>
Look at the crowd, folks!<NL>
Look at the crowd!<END>

<NL>
Looks like all of Luca has turned<NL>
out to cheer the Goers on!<END>

<NL>
They know, I know,<NL>
and you know, folks!<END>

<NL>
The [Luca Goers] are number one!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It's like this every year, ya?<NL>
Don't let it bother you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Stop right there, Goers!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You guys are smilin' now,<NL>
but not for long!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
'Cause this year, us<NL>
[Aurochs] are taking the cup!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What in [Yevon2]'s name<NL>
were you doing up there?<END>

Datto<NL>
We sure stood out, though!<END>

Letty<NL>
We were on the sphere!<END>

<NL>
We were?<END>

<NL>
[Maester Mika] is here!<END>

<NL>
Already?<END>

<NL>
The number 3 dock!<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's up now?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Maester Mika] has arrived, that's what!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Mika? Maester?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Maester Mika] is the leader of<NL>
all the peoples of [Spira].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
He's come all the way from [Bevelle].<NL>
The tournament is being held to<NL>
honor his fifty years as maester.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Fifty years? Shouldn't he<NL>
be, uh, retired by now?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hey!<NL>
Mind your mouth, now.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Let's all go see him!<END>

Map jump here<END>

<NL>
All the way from [Kilika],<NL>
it's the [Kilika Beasts]!<END>

<NL>
High Summoner [Ohalland] used to play<NL>
for them--a big name to live up to.<END>

<NL>
Their hometown was recently attacked<NL>
by [Sin]. Isn't that right, Jimma?<END>

<NL>
Yes, Bobba. They're going to<NL>
be pulling out all the stops to try<NL>
and bring back the cup this year.<END>

<NL>
Exciting, isn't it, folks?<END>

<NL>
Our next team off the ramp is...<END>

<NL>
Well, well, well!<NL>
If it isn't the [Besaid Aurochs]!<END>
