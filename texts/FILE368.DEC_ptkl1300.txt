Hey! You awake?<NL>
Cap'n [Wakka]'s waitin' for you!<END>

<NL>
[Wakka]'s waitin' for you!<END>

<NL>
Hey!<END>

<NL>
I wanted to believe it<NL>
was just a bad dream.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
That this was all a dream and when<NL>
I opened my eyes, everything would<NL>
be back to normal.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But, when morning came,<NL>
nothing had changed.<END>

<NL>
Daddy...<END>

<NL>
The sea sure looks beautiful<NL>
from here, but [Sin]'s lurking<NL>
out there, somewhere.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It gives me the creeps<NL>
just thinking about it.<END>

<NL>
Yeah, I'm repairing this now,<NL>
but it'll all be destroyed<NL>
when [Sin] comes again.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He destroys it, I fix it. I fix<NL>
it and he destroys it. It's a<NL>
neverending cycle, I tell you.<END>

<NL>
It's not just [Kilika]. All of<NL>
[Spira] has been ravaged by [Sin].<END>

<NL>
A summoner named [Dona] passed<NL>
through here a while ago.<NL>
She'll probably be taking the ferry.<END>

<NL>
That [Dona]'s quite an attractive<NL>
lady, but she's a bit on the cold<NL>
side, if you know what I mean.<END>

<NL>
Everything is in shambles.<NL>
I don't know where to start.<END>

<NL>
There's not a smile in all of<NL>
Kilika, thanks to [Sin].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But if we win the next tournament,<NL>
that should cheer everyone up.<END>

<NL>
Our loved ones made it to the<NL>
[Farplane] with Lady [Yuna]'s help.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We are truly grateful<NL>
for [Yevon2]'s blessing.<END>

<NL>
I'm sure my grandchildren made it<NL>
to the [Farplane] in peace.<END>

<NL>
[Sin] is a divine punishment<NL>
upon the people. There is<NL>
nothing we can do about it.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We can only rely upon [Yevon2]'s<NL>
teachings and the summoners<NL>
to help us through this.<END>
