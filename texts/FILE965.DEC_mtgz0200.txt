[Rikku]<NL>
[Zanarkand] is on the<NL>
other side, you know?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I know.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Yunie] is gonna get the<NL>
Final Aeon, you know?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I know.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I still haven't thought of anything.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Me neither.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
What are we gonna do?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We'll do something!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We just don't know enough yet.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Until we do, we<NL>
really can't help [Yuna].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's go to [Zanarkand].<NL>
We'll find something there.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It'll all come together.<NL>
I know it!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Hey...<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Just now, you sounded<NL>
like a leader, you know?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Star of the [Zanarkand Abes]!<NL>
Didn't anyone tell you?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Ah, the son of [Jecht].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Rikku], run ahead and tell [Auron]!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You are not fighting him alone!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Just go! Go!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Now is your time to die.<NL>
Prepare yourself, son of [Jecht].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Not if I can help it!<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Save some for [Kimahri]!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Lady [Yuna], it is a pleasure.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna]!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
A sending, so soon?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Allow me to say something to<NL>
the last [Ronso] before I leave.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Yours was...truly a gallant race.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
They threw themselves<NL>
at me to bar my path.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
One...after another...<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
No...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Kimahri]...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
You could end the suffering<NL>
of this poor [Ronso].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I don't understand you!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Allow [Kimahri] to die, and<NL>
release him from his pain.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
[Spira]...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
is a land of suffering and sorrow<NL>
caught in a spiral of death.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
To destroy--to heal--[Spira],<NL>
I will become [Sin].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Yes, with your help.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Come with me, [Yuna].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Once I have become the next [Sin],<NL>
your father will be freed again.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What do you know?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Pitiful mortal.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Your hope ends here.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
And your meaningless<NL>
existence with it.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And stay up there!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
He will become [Sin]...<NL>
with my help.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Lies. Forget them.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
If he becomes [Sin],<NL>
Sir [Jecht] will be saved.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
We're leaving.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You know something!<NL>
Tell me!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Tell me!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Sin]'s...my old man.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You hit your head?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Sin] is my old man.<NL>
My old man became [Sin]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I don't know how or why he did it.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I felt him, inside.<NL>
And when I did, I knew it was true.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
My old man is [Spira]'s suffering.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sorry.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Even...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
knowing that [Sin] is your father...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Still, you know, I must...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I know.<NL>
Let's get him.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I think my old man would want that.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You'd fight your own father?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah.<NL>
No problem there.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Uh... 'Bout your old man...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You sure this ain't some kinda<NL>
bad toxin dream or something?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Then, [Chappu]...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I, uh... I think I'll just<NL>
pretend I didn't hear nothing.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I'm getting a little confused, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why... Why'd all<NL>
this have to happen?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
We'll learn when<NL>
we arrive. Soon.<END>
