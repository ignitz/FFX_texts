[Kimahri]<NL>
[Yuna]!<END>

[Dona]<NL>
She's not here.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Hello again.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Wait there until we have<NL>
performed the sending.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
They died...protecting us.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
It's not much, but the least we can<NL>
do is give them a proper sending.<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
Hey, what's "sacrificed"?<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
The [Al Bhed] said summoners<NL>
were being "sacrificed."<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
That summoners shouldn't<NL>
have to do a pilgrimage...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
The pilgrimages have to stop!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You know, don't you?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Summoners journey to<NL>
get the Final Aeon.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Yuna] told you, didn't she?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Was I the only one<NL>
who didn't know?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We weren't hiding it...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
It was just...too hard to say.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
But that is our choice...<END>

[Dona]<NL>
We all live in fear<NL>
of [Sin]. You know that.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
A world without [Sin]...<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
That is the dream of<NL>
all [Yevon2]'s children.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
We summoners have the power<NL>
to make that dream come true.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
And we will use that power,<NL>
even if it means our lives!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I can't let her die!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'll find her!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why couldn't they trust guardians<NL>
to protect the summoners?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The [Al Bhed] had no right<NL>
stopping their pilgrimage!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
If they don't, and<NL>
they get to Zanarkand...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
They might defeat [Sin].<NL>
[Yunie] could...<NL>
but then she...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Yunie] will die, you know?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
With the Final Aeon, she can<NL>
beat [Sin]. But then...but then...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
If she calls it, then the<NL>
Final Aeon's going to kill her!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Even if she defeats [Sin], it<NL>
will kill [Yunie] too, you know!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Tell me why!<NL>
Why were you hiding it?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why didn't I know?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Lulu]! How could you? How could you?<NL>
Isn't she like a sister to you?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I thought you were family!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why don't you do something, [Wakka]?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Don't you think we tried to stop her?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
She follows...her heart.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Yuna], she knew what she was doing<NL>
when she chose to become a summoner.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
To face [Sin], ya? [Yuna] knew!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
But, [Wakka], that's just totally wrong!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Summoners shouldn't have to<NL>
sacrifice themselves...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
just so the rest of Spira<NL>
can be happy, right?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And I've been telling [Yuna]...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's go to Zanarkand together!<NL>
Let's beat [Sin]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I told her all the things<NL>
we could...we could...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And all along, the whole time,<NL>
I didn't know anything!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But [Yuna], she'd...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
just smile.<END>

<END>
