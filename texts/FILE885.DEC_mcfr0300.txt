<Cor 43>[Jecht]'s Spheres<Cor 41><NL>
Spheres that document [Jecht]'s journey are<NL>
hidden all over [Spira]. Defeating the<NL>
Spherimorph has unlocked the seals<NL>
that once bound the spheres. Find them!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
This place...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's just water, isn't it?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
This is what spheres are made of.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It absorbs and preserves<NL>
people's memories.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What's that?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Fiends are also<NL>
attracted to these places.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Whoa, this is old!<NL>
Don't know if you can play it back.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Jecht] left it here ten years ago.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Play it back.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's the point?<NL>
He wasn't on some pleasure cruise.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I think there's more.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
He sounded almost serious,<NL>
but it was too late.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
He was serious.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Jecht] had already<NL>
accepted his fate.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
His fate?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Jecht]... He...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
He was always talking<NL>
about going home, to [Zanarkand].<END>

[Auron]<NL>
That's why he took all those pictures--<NL>
to show them to you when he returned.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
But as he journeyed with us<NL>
and came to understand [Spira],<NL>
and [Braska]'s resolve...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It happened gradually,<NL>
but [Jecht] changed.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
He decided he would join [Braska]<NL>
in his fight against [Sin].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So then, he gave up going home?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
That was his decision.<END>

<NL>
I guess I understood.<END>

<NL>
My old man...<END>

<NL>
He knew there was no way<NL>
back home, back to [Zanarkand].<END>

<NL>
He wanted to go home,<NL>
but he knew he couldn't.<END>

<NL>
He couldn't go on<NL>
until he accepted it.<END>

<NL>
Besides...<END>

<NL>
even if he had<NL>
found a way back...<END>

<NL>
I don't think he would've<NL>
left his friends behind before<NL>
their journey was complete.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
All right!<NL>
Let's go, guys!<END>

<NL>
Maybe I had to start<NL>
accepting my own fate.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Wait.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Jecht] loved you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, come on, please!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
He just didn't know how<NL>
to express it, he said.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Enough about my old man, okay?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I just thought you should know.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Okay.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Thanks.<END>
