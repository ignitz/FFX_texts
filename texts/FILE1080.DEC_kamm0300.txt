[Auron]<NL>
Why am I doing this?<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Hey! Hold it steady!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
You're gonna spoil it!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
What do you see there, my lord?<END>

[Braska]<NL>
Oh, I was just...thinking.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
This is important!<NL>
No foolin' around!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Whoa!<END>

[Braska]<NL>
Are you all right?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Auron]<NL>
Now there's a scene for posterity!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Yeah, yeah...<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
What I am about to tell<NL>
you is the unclouded truth.<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
I swear it on my honor<NL>
as a [Guado].<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
Listen to me very carefully,<NL>
for I shall tell you the truth<NL>
about my son, [Seymor].<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
His mind is closed even to<NL>
me, a maester of [Yevon2].<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
But I can feel flames of<NL>
darkness burning in his heart.<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
He is using [Yevon2], the [Guado],<NL>
and even the summoners.<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
If he is not stopped, he will surely bring<NL>
destruction and chaos to [Spira].<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
I will leave this world soon,<NL>
killed by my own son.<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
But I do not fault him.<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
Because I was not wise enough,<NL>
he has suffered, and become twisted.<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
I could not protect him and his mother<NL>
from the world and its cruelty.<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
I will accept death as<NL>
punishment for my deeds.<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
But whoever is watching this...<END>

[Jyscal]<NL>
I implore you to stop [Seymor]!<NL>
Stop my son.<END>
