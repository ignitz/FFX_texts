[Wakka]<NL>
These stone steps have<NL>
a history, you know?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yep, Lord [Ohalland]<NL>
trained here at his peak.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
A race, huh?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Think you can beat me?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Yuna], if you would.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Ready?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hey! Hey!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Kids...<END>

Datto<NL>
L-Look out!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Everyone, quick!<NL>
Sinspawn!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeesh!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Sorry about that!<NL>
Hoped to break you in a little slower.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Being a guardian's tiring!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You handled yourself pretty well.<NL>
You got talent.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Nah.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, what are these<NL>
"[sinspawn]" anyway?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Fiends. They fall from [Sin]'s body,<NL>
and are left behind in its wake.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Leave 'em alone, and [Sin] comes<NL>
back for 'em. You gotta be quick!<END>

<NL>
That moment when [Wakka] told<NL>
me I had talent in battle...<END>

<NL>
I think that was when I started seriously<NL>
considering becoming a guardian.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
So, uh...they got fiends<NL>
in [Zanarkand], too?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Just a few. It's a big deal when<NL>
one shows up, though.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey! Since when have you believed<NL>
me about [Zanarkand], anyway?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I been thinking.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Maybe people [Sin]<NL>
gets to don't die.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Maybe [Sin] carries 'em through time.<NL>
Like a thousand years through time.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
And then, one day,<NL>
maybe they just pop back, see?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Amazing. Simply amazing.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You make up one theory after another,<NL>
refusing to face the simple truth.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Sin] didn't take<NL>
[Chappu] anywhere.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Sin] crushed him and left him<NL>
on the [Djose] shore!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Your brother won't just pop back.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Oh, and one more thing.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
No matter how much you want it,<NL>
no one can take [Chappu]'s place.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
No one can replace<NL>
Sir [Jecht], for that matter.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
And there's no replacement<NL>
for Lord [Braska], either.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
It's pointless to think<NL>
about it, and sad.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I...I could never be<NL>
what [Chappu] was.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Well, stuff happens.<NL>
Best not to worry.<END>

<NL>
[Wakka], [Lulu], and<NL>
[Wakka]'s brother [Chappu].<END>

<NL>
Something had happened between them<NL>
a long time ago. I was sure of it.<END>

<NL>
Well, whatever it was, it was none<NL>
of my business, that's for sure.<NL>
Best not to go there.<END>

<NL>
You, there!<NL>
Your kind is not welcome in this holy place!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
You shall not pass!<END>
