[Kelk]<NL>
conspired with the [Al Bhed]<NL>
and joined in their insurrection.<END>

[Kelk]<NL>
These are traitorous and unforgivable<NL>
crimes that disturb the order of [Yevon2].<END>

[Kelk]<NL>
Tell this court what possessed<NL>
you to participate in such violence.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Their battles, their sacrifices--<NL>
were they all in vain?<END>

[Mika]<NL>
There is nothing futile in the life<NL>
and death of a summoner.<END>

<NL>
The High Court of [Yevon2]<NL>
is now in session.<END>

<NL>
The sacred offices of this court<NL>
seek nothing but absolute truth,<NL>
in [Yevon2]'s name.<END>

<NL>
To those on trial: Believe in<NL>
[Yevon2], and speak only the truth.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Master Kelk Ronso].<END>

[Kelk]<NL>
Summoner [Yuna].<END>

[Kelk]<NL>
You have sworn to protect<NL>
the people of [Yevon2], true?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes.<END>

[Kelk]<NL>
Then, consider:<END>

[Kelk]<NL>
You have inflicted dire injury<NL>
upon Maester [Seymor] [Guado]...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Your Grace...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The real traitor is Maester [Seymor]!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
He killed his father [Jyscal]<NL>
with his own hands!<END>

[Kelk]<NL>
What is this!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Hmm?<NL>
Hadn't you heard?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Not only that...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Maester [Seymor] is already dead!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
It is a summoner's sacred duty to send<NL>
the souls of the departed to the Farplane!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna] was only doing<NL>
her job as a summoner!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Grand [Maester Mika2]...<NL>
Please, send [Seymor] now!<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Send the unsent to<NL>
where they belong?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Maester?<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Send the dead...hmm?<END>

[Mika]<NL>
You would have to send me, too.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What!<END>

[Kelk]<NL>
Grand [Maester Mika] is a wise leader.<NL>
Even in death, he is invaluable to Spira.<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
Enlightened rule by the dead is preferable<NL>
to the misguided failures of the living.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Life is but a passing dream, but<NL>
the death that follows is eternal.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Men die. Beasts die. Trees die.<NL>
Even continents perish.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Only the power of death<NL>
truly commands in Spira.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Resisting its power is futile.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But what of [Sin]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I am a summoner, my lord,<NL>
like my father before me!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I am on a pilgrimage to stop<NL>
the death that [Sin] brings.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Are you... Are you telling<NL>
me that, too, is futile?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Grand [Maester Mika2],<NL>
I am not alone!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
All the people who<NL>
have opposed [Sin]...<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Not in vain.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
No matter how many summoners give<NL>
their lives, [Sin] cannot be truly defeated.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
The rebirth cannot be stopped.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Yet the courage of those who<NL>
fight gives the people hope.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Never futile...<NL>
but never ending.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Mika]<NL>
Indeed, that is<NL>
the essence of [Yevon2].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Lord [Mika]!<END>

[Mika]<NL>
[Yevon2] is embodied by eternal,<NL>
unchanging continuity, summoner.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
No...that can't be right!<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Those who question these truths--<NL>
they are traitors!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Lord [Mika]!<END>

[Mika]<NL>
How fares the [Ronso] maester?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
It seems my father's<NL>
murder troubles him.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Ever the [Ronso].<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Hard-headed,<NL>
hardly useful.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
However...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
The summoner [Yuna],<NL>
daughter to [High Summoner Braska]...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
She may be of some<NL>
use to us alive.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
She has disturbed<NL>
the order of [Yevon2].<END>

[Mika]<NL>
She cannot be allowed to live.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I understand.<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
Let it go, [Seymor].<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
No one thrown into the Via<NL>
Purifico has ever survived.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Yet there is always a small<NL>
chance that they might.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Place guards at the exit.<NL>
Kill any who emerge.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Sir. Leave that to me.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
First your father, now your bride?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Allow me to do this<NL>
because she is my bride.<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
Wait. I will go, too.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
You do not trust me?<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
Would you trust a man<NL>
who murdered his father?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Very well.<NL>
As you wish.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Why are you here?<NL>
You must go and defeat [Sin], quickly!<END>

[Mika]<NL>
You have obtained the Final Aeon<NL>
from [Yunalesca], have you not?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, we did meet her.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
We fought and defeated her.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
What!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Summoners and guardians will<NL>
be sacrificed for the<NL>
Final Summoning no more!<END>

[Mika]<NL>
You have profaned and subverted<NL>
a thousand-year-old tradition? <END>

[Mika]<NL>
Fools! Infants!<NL>
Do you realize what you've done?<END>

[Mika]<NL>
You've taken away the only<NL>
means of calming [Sin]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, maybe that's not the only way!<NL>
We think we've got another.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Why...<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Preposterous!<NL>
There is no other way!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
The grand maester, running away?<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Spira has lost its only hope.<NL>
Destruction is inevitable.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Yu Yevon's spiral of<NL>
death will consume us all.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
I have no desire to<NL>
watch [Spira] die.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It won't die!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Who is this Yu Yevon guy?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Lady [Yunalesca] also mentioned him.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Wait, gramps!<NL>
Who's Yu Yevon?<END>

[Mika]<NL>
He who crafts the souls of<NL>
the dead into unholy armor.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
An armor called [Sin].<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Clad in it, Yu Yevon is invincible.<END>

[Mika]<NL>
And the only thing that could have<NL>
pierced that armor, you have destroyed!<END>

[Mika]<NL>
Nothing can stop it now.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Disappear on us, will ya?<NL>
Rotten son of a shoopuf!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Where...where is the grand maester?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
He, um...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
He's not here yet.<NL>
How long must we wait?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
That's odd... I'll go<NL>
look for His Grace.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's you.<END>

<NL>
Come, to my room.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Okay.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Who you talking to?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh. Uh, no one.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I must go see the [fayth].<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I see.<END>
