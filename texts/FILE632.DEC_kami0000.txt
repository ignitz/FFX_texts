Lightning can strike at any time,<NL>
so keep moving.<END>

The lightning rod towers absorb nearby<NL>
lightning. Seek shelter under them.<END>

<TEXT>
When there are no towers nearby,<NL>
you can dodge lightning by pressing [Botão Círculo].<END>

<TEXT>
Hit [Botão Círculo] as soon as you see a<NL>
lightning flash. If successful,<NL>
you can dodge the thunderbolt.<END>

<TEXT>
Constantly mashing [Botão Círculo],<NL>
however, can be dangerous.<END>

Good luck on your journey.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Ah, good day!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hi there.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Is it true?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I heard that Maester [Seymor]<NL>
and Lady [Yuna] are to be wed!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
It's such great news!<NL>
I have to tell everyone!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Where'd you hear that?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
From the [Guado].<NL>
They were all very excited!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm afraid you heard a little wrong.<NL>
[Yuna]'s gonna turn him down.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Oh... Really?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Yep! No wedding!<NL>
<CHOICE2>Just kidding!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I see...<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
That's unfortunate.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Well I'm sure that people<NL>
would have rejoiced all over [Spira].<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Hey!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
It will not do to joke<NL>
about a thing like that.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Please give Lady [Yuna]<NL>
my best regards!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Maester [Seymor]<NL>
and Lady [Yuna]--how wonderful!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Oh, please go ahead.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Oh, no...<NL>
We're here.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How are we supposed to cross that?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
See the lightning rod towers?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The lightning is drawn<NL>
to them...hopefully.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We head north, not too near and not<NL>
too far from the towers, ya?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Meaning we should<NL>
avoid wide, open areas.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I think I forgot something<NL>
in [Guadosalam].<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Nice knowing you.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Okay, okay! I'll go!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Whoa! That was a close one!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Stop kidding around.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yes, ma'am...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hmm? What's wrong?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Eh heh heh heh heh heh heh...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
"Heh heh heh..."<NL>
You're givin' me the creeps!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Let's go rest over there!<NL>
Please?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
This storm never stops.<NL>
Better to cross quickly.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I know, but...<NL>
Just for a little while?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Heh, well? What now?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I wanna go home!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I hate lightning!<NL>
I hate thunder!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Well, hello there.<NL>
Would you like to hear about this place?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Maybe next time.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Sure.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Pity.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Very well, let me tell<NL>
you about the Crossing.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
A long time ago,<NL>
this place was a traveller's nightmare.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
"Plains of lightning, plains of thunder,<NL>
those who cross are torn asunder."<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Or...so they used to say.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Then a man by the<NL>
name of Bilghen appeared.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Using machina, he built towers<NL>
that served as lightning rods<NL>
across the plains.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Finally, travellers were<NL>
able to cross in safety.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Bilghen was building<NL>
that tower over there...<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
when he was struck<NL>
and killed by lightning.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Bilghen was an [Al Bhed].<NL>
Our history books never mention him.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Take care, and farewell.<END>

<NL>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Guadosalam]? It's probably<NL>
crawling with [Seymor]'s cronies.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Now's no time to be picking fights<NL>
with the [Guado], that's for sure.<END>
