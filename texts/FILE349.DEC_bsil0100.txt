[Yuna]<NL>
Goodbye.<END>

<NL>
Lady [Yuna]!<NL>
Don't forget me, okay?<END>

<NL>
I'll be good while you're<NL>
gone! I promise, ya?<END>

<NL>
Here, take this. Daddy<NL>
says it's an offering.<END>

<NL>
I have to keep watch!<NL>
[Sin] could come any day!<END>

<NL>
When are the [Aurochs]<NL>
gonna come back?<END>

<NL>
All I wanna do is join the Crusaders,<NL>
but they say I'm too young!<END>

<NL>
I wonder if the fiends will<NL>
go away once Sin's gone...<END>

<NL>
We'll miss Lady Yuna!<NL>
Come back soon, ya?<END>

<NL>
Where are you going<NL>
on that big boat?<END>

<NL>
When is Lady [Yuna] going<NL>
to bring us the Calm?<END>

<NL>
Look at me! I'm Lady [Yuna]!<NL>
I'll be a summoner when I grow up!<END>

<NL>
There's a ship, flying in the sky!<NL>
I saw it! Honest!<END>

<NL>
I sung and everything, so now<NL>
Lady [Yuna]'s Calm will come, ya?<END>

<NL>
I heard there's some foreigners around.<NL>
Be on your guard!<END>

<NL>
There was a summoner here a while ago.<NL>
One of his guardians was my age!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
His name was [Pacce] or something.<END>

<NL>
Some mean-looking people were here,<NL>
looking for [Yuna]!<END>

<NL>
I wonder if all this singing's<NL>
really gonna help beat [Sin].<END>

<NL>
I knew this time would<NL>
come someday. I knew.<END>

<NL>
Please watch over Lady [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
Here, have this.<NL>
You may find use for it.<END>

<NL>
A summoner arrived<NL>
here just recently.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He seemed to have disappeared.<NL>
But where to, so quickly?<END>

<NL>
I believe his name was<NL>
Lord [Isaaru]...yes, that's it.<END>

<NL>
I heard the sailors' gossip<NL>
about Lady [Yuna] getting married?<END>

<NL>
I should think Lady [Yuna] would be the<NL>
last to marry and quit her pilgrimage!<END>

<NL>
The people of [Besaid] are friends to Lady [Yuna].<NL>
Come to us if you are ever in need.<END>

<NL>
That flying ship--now that's what<NL>
I call a blessing of [Yevon2].<END>

<NL>
I got separated from Sir [Luzzu]<NL>
and [Gatta] during the battle.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They haven't come back yet.<NL>
Where could they be?<END>

<NL>
That new plan, it must be working.<NL>
I mean, I haven't seen [Sin] around, have you?<END>

<NL>
Hey, no one's loafing around here!<NL>
I'm keeping a lookout for [Sin]!<END>

<NL>
[Sin] is still out there.<NL>
This is a job for the [Crusader]s!<END>

<NL>
Haven't seen [Sin] in a long while.<NL>
Perhaps the [Crusader]s have stopped it at last?<END>

<NL>
Oh hoh hoh, have I news for you!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
The daughter of Lord [Braska]<NL>
is to marry the leader of the [Guado]!<END>

<NL>
What? Already knew, did you?<NL>
Hmph. You're no fun.<END>

<NL>
We're getting fewer and fewer<NL>
passengers--maybe due to all<NL>
the turmoil in the temples.<END>

<NL>
Just once in my life,<NL>
I'd like to ride on a flying ship.<END>

<NL>
Oh! There are so many<NL>
things I want to tell her.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But seeing her there, smiling...<NL>
I just can't say them.<END>

<NL>
Hey, you! The sea's crawling with<NL>
fiends, so give this to [Yuna], okay?<END>

<NL>
I won't cry...<NL>
I won't, ya?<END>

<NL>
They're really leaving.<END>

<NL>
Here, a farewell gift<NL>
from all the village.<END>

<NL>
I understand why some people<NL>
didn't come down here.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's hard to say goodbye.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
May [Yevon2]'s blessings be with<NL>
our summoner on her pilgrimage.<END>

<NL>
Here, a gift from the temple<NL>
to sanctify her departure.<END>

<NL>
The journey will be long. Believe the<NL>
teachings, and you will not go astray.<END>
