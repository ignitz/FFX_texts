How many times do I have<NL>
to tell you? I'm a summoner!<END>

<NL>
Sorry, ma'am!<NL>
No exceptions!<END>

[Dona]<NL>
You dare impede a<NL>
summoner's pilgrimage?<END>

<NL>
Sorry, ma'am!<NL>
No exceptions!<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Useless!<END>

<NL>
I'm sorry, I can't let you pass.<END>

<NL>
I know it's a pain, but<NL>
I can't let you pass, okay?<END>

<NL>
Come on! We're trying to<NL>
rid the world of [Sin] here!<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Oh, it's you.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
As you can see, not<NL>
even summoners can pass.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
But they'll call on us in<NL>
the end. Just wait and see.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
In the meantime,<NL>
I think I'll have a nap.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Oh, [Barthello]?<END>

<NL>
The Mushroom Rock Road is off-limits to non-<NL>
Crusader personnel until the end of the mission!<END>

<NL>
We apologize for the inconvenience,<NL>
but this road is closed!<END>

<NL>
Any donation toward [Operation Mi'ihen]<NL>
would be greatly appreciated!<END>

<NL>
Thank you for your generosity!<NL>
Here, you should have this.<END>

<NL>
Many thanks! This is for you.<END>

<NL>
Thank you! Please accept this.<END>

Sir!<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Support units are in place.<NL>
Mounted units have finished all exercises.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Evacuation of civilians<NL>
almost complete, sir!<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Just a few stragglers--<NL>
nothing to worry about, sir.<END>

<NL>
Good. Were there<NL>
any problems?<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
No problems, sir.<END>

<NL>
Excellent! The first stage<NL>
is complete, then!<END>

<NL>
Chocobo Knights--to your assigned<NL>
positions for [Operation Mi'ihen]!<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Sir!<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Sir!<END>

<NL>
Hey, you're a summoner and her guardians,<NL>
right? Sorry for the inconvenience.<END>

<NL>
Thank you for your cooperation!<END>

<NL>
What, they didn't tell you?<END>

<NL>
We're bringing [sinspawn] from<NL>
all over [Spira] here.<END>

<NL>
Sinspawn inevitably draw [Sin], right?<END>

<NL>
We're going to lure it into a trap!<END>

<NL>
This mission, [Operation Mi'ihen],<NL>
is a Crusader-[Al Bhed] joint mission.<END>

<NL>
We [Crusader]s lure [Sin] in,<NL>
and the [Al Bhed] strike it down.<END>

<NL>
You see, [Al Bhed] hate<NL>
[Sin] as much as we do.<END>

<NL>
They managed to salvage ancient machina.<END>

<NL>
They say they're as powerful<NL>
as the mighty aeons.<END>

<NL>
Well, you know machina<NL>
are forbidden by [Yevon2].<END>

<NL>
Ah...on second thought, let's not<NL>
go there. Better for you not to know.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s in [Operation Mi'ihen]<NL>
have all been excommunicated.<END>

<NL>
My own family won't<NL>
even speak to me now.<END>

<NL>
We have to beat [Sin] today.<END>

<NL>
Otherwise, there's nowhere for us to go.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
[Gatta] and [Luzzu]<NL>
reporting, sir!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
This is the last of them.<END>

<NL>
Good to have you with us.<NL>
Go on through!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Show me how to<NL>
play blitz sometime!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Wait around. We'll have<NL>
[Sin] beaten in no time!<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Captain [Lucil] and [Elma]<NL>
should have been here by now.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
What's taking [Elma] so long?<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
You have to leave your chocobos here.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Come on, everyone off!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
So we meet again, Lady [Yuna].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Y-Yes?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
You look troubled.<NL>
Is there anything I can do?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Well...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I see.<END>

<NL>
Maester [Seymor]. Let me show<NL>
you to the command center.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Hold. I have a request.<END>

<NL>
Yes, Your Grace?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I need to have Summoner [Yuna]<NL>
and her guardians let through<NL>
to the command center.<END>

<NL>
But, Maester [Seymor], sir.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Do not worry. I will<NL>
take full responsibility.<END>

<NL>
Very well. They may pass.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
It is done.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thank you, Your Grace.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna], it's time to go.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Oh! Right!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Who does he think he is?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He's a maester.<NL>
Better get used to it, ya?<END>

<NL>
Hello!<NL>
No charge this time!<END>

<NL>
You get to ride a chocobo once for<NL>
free, but I see you already have one.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
You can rent one free next time, then.<END>

<NL>
Do you want to ride a chocobo?<END>

<NL>
Please be careful on your trip.<END>

<NL>
Do you want me to teach you<NL>
how to ride a chocobo?<END>

<NL>
And I'm delivering food<NL>
for the soldiers!<END>

<NL>
The operation's gonna start soon.<NL>
All civilians must leave.<END>

<NL>
Then [Sin]'s gonna eat you!<NL>
Mom said [Sin] eats bad people.<END>

<NL>
The operation's gonna start soon.<NL>
All civilians must leave!<END>

<NL>
We're [Crusader]s, too.<NL>
We have a lot of work to do.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
My job is to clean up everyone's stuff!<END>

<NL>
Big job, huh?<END>

<NL>
What if you don't?<END>

<NL>
Yikes.<END>

<NL>
A great maester is here, too, so<NL>
we're gonna work really hard!<END>

<NL>
We are securing the Highroad<NL>
under [Maester Kinoc]'s orders.<END>

<NL>
Those [Al Bhed] have no shame. They came<NL>
all the way down here to make money.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They have some nerve showin' up here.<NL>
It's their fault the operation failed.<END>

<NL>
Sooner or later, we warrior monks<NL>
will crush the [Al Bhed2].<END>

<NL>
All this stuff here,<NL>
the [Crusader]s left behind.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They all ran away in a hurry.<END>

<NL>
They caged a [sinspawn]<NL>
in this! Damn fools.<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Help him look for them.<NL>
<CHOICE2>I've got better things to do.<END>

<NL>
There aren't many guards<NL>
beyond here, so watch it.<END>

<NL>
Ideally, we'd like to station men<NL>
at the [Mushroom Rock Road], too.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But we're really shorthanded.<NL>
Please understand.<END>

<CHOICE2>I can afford 1,000 Gil.<NL>
<CHOICE3>It's your lucky day! 10,000 Gil!<NL>
<CHOICE4>I'd rather not.<END>

<NL>
Not enough Gil.<END>

<NL>
We've been so busy with guard duty,<NL>
we've been using that cage as shelter.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Praise be to Yevon that nobody<NL>
cleared it after the operation.<END>

<NL>
The [Al Bhed2] from the travel agency<NL>
bring us food now and then.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I still don't understand them, but they're<NL>
my friends so long as they feed us.<END>

<NL>
You may pass.<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks and the [Guado2]<NL>
guarding this area have left.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Maybe they went after the traitors.<END>

<NL>
I guess the [Crusader]s are the<NL>
only ones we can really count on.<END>

<NL>
When we saw the machina airship,<NL>
we sang. That [Al Bhed] kid did, too.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's strange how we can all sing<NL>
the same song even though we don't<NL>
speak the same language.<END>

<NL>
Maybe there is a way for the people of<NL>
[Yevon2] and the [Al Bhed2] to get along.<END>
