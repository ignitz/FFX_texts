I'm supposed to study real<NL>
hard and become a nun.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But I just wanna run around<NL>
and play at the beach.<END>

<NL>
I ignored the precepts and<NL>
went into the cloister once.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Boy, did I get in trouble!<END>

<NL>
What happened to the Crusaders?<NL>
They all look so sad.<END>

<NL>
We're supposed to sing when we see<NL>
the flying ship, right? See, I knew that!<END>

<NL>
We saw the flying ship so we all sang our<NL>
hearts out. I think I sang the best!<END>

<NL>
Guess what? I really like<NL>
studying the scriptures!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
The monks give us lots<NL>
of sweets if we study hard!<END>

<NL>
My mommy and daddy are at a place<NL>
called the far plain.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I wonder when they're coming home?<END>

<NL>
I sang the Hymn to the monk,<NL>
since he was feeling sad.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He smiled and gave me a<NL>
pat on the head.<END>

Why are all the monks getting antsy?<END>

<NL>
We all sang together, so<NL>
why isn't [Sin] dead yet?<END>
