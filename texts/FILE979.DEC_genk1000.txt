[']Thank you.[/']<END>

Driver<NL>
Shoopuf launchin'!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hey.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Take a look.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whoa!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
A sunken city!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
A machina city--<NL>
a thousand years old!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
They built the city on top<NL>
of bridges across the river.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
But the weight of the city<NL>
caused the bridges to collapse,<NL>
and it all sank to the bottom.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Right. It's a good lesson.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
A lesson?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yeah.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why build a city over a river, ya?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh... Well, it would be convenient,<NL>
with all that water there.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Nope, that's not why.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
They just wanted to prove they<NL>
could defy the laws of nature!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hmmm?<NL>
I'm not so sure about that.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Yevon2] has taught us:<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
When humans have power,<NL>
they seek to use it.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
If you don't stop them,<NL>
they go too far, ya?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, but don't you<NL>
use machina, too?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Like the stadium and stuff, right?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Yevon, it decides...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
which machina we may use,<NL>
and which we may not.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So what kind of machina<NL>
may we not use, then?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Remember [Operation Mi'ihen]?<NL>
That kind.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Or war will rage again.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
War?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
More than a thousand years ago...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Mankind waged war using<NL>
machina to kill!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
They kept building more and<NL>
more powerful machina.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
They made weapons so powerful...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
It was thought they could<NL>
destroy the entire world.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The people feared that<NL>
[Spira] would be destroyed.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But the war did not stop!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Wh-What happened then?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Sin] came, and it destroyed<NL>
the cities and their machina.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The war ended...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
and our reward...<NL>
was [Sin].<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
So, [Sin]'s our punishment for<NL>
lettin' things get out of hand, eh?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Man, that's rough.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yeah, it is.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But, it's not like the<NL>
machina are bad.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Only as bad as their users.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It's because of people like the<NL>
[Al Bhed] screwin' everything up!<END>

Driver<NL>
Whatsh could thatsh be?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Sit down!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
S-Sorry!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
The [Al Bhed]!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Are you hurt?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
No, I'm fine.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Grrah! Those [Al Bhed]!<END>

Driver<NL>
Ish ebullibody okay?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm sorry! We're all okay now!<END>

Driver<NL>
Shoopuf full shpeed aheads!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Damn the [Al Bhed]!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What do they want from us?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Could it have something<NL>
to do with Luca?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What are they after [Yuna] for?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Wait!<NL>
They're mad they lost the tournament!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Or, wait!<NL>
They're mad about [Operation Mi'ihen]!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I wonder...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Didn't [Kimahri]'s<NL>
clansman say something...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
about summoners...disappearing?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Ah!<NL>
So the [Al Bhed] are behind that!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Those sand-blasted grease monkeys!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, [Wakka].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's no use complaining<NL>
about the [Al Bhed] now, right?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We'll protect [Yuna]<NL>
from anyone, anywhere.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's that easy.<NL>
That's all I need to know!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Well...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I guess so.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You're right.<END>
