What's up?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna]'s saying she<NL>
wants you with us.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I want to ask you to be my guardian.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Yuna]! What?<NL>
This is no time for jokes, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He may be a [blitzball] whiz kid,<NL>
but up against fiends, he's a newbie.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Not a guardian, then...<NL>
I just want him nearby.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What? What do you mean?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's just that, well...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
We're all going to the temple anyway.<NL>
Can't this wait till later?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm sorry.<NL>
I shouldn't have...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
There's nothing to be sorry about.<NL>
I'm just not really sure<NL>
what's going on.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
My apologies.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Told you it'd be rough going in there.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Only the Lord of the Wood could<NL>
fall asleep after a battle like that.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Let it go.<NL>
Save your strength for the next battle.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
A summoner and her guardians.<NL>
Very impressive!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Sir, we should fight, too!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
We'll get our chance soon enough.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Young [Crusader]s gather round!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
We'll beat [Sin] into the ground!<END>

<NL>
On our way, sir!<END>

<NL>
Yes, sir! On our way, sir!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
The Ochu is no garden-variety fiend.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
We could throw a hundred [Crusader]s<NL>
at it and still lose.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Ochu poison is a surefire way<NL>
to get to the [Farplane], and fast.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
The fiend before us is<NL>
Ochu, Lord of the Wood!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
We've had trouble with this one before.<NL>
Remember, discretion is the better<NL>
part of valor.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Do your best, kid.<NL>
[Wakka]'s counting on you.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Standing guard, sir!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Company, halt!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Don't even think<NL>
about fighting it.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Hey, after the tournament,<NL>
you should join the [Crusader]s!<END>

<NL>
I can't believe you defeated Ochu!<NL>
Say, how would you like to join the [Crusader]s?<END>

<NL>
Here's a little something for your victory.<END>

<NL>
I'd steer clear of Ochu, Lord of the Wood.<NL>
It's a powerful fiend even we [Crusader]s avoid.<END>

<NL>
Are you heading for <Cor 88>[Kilika Temple]<Cor 41>?<NL>
Then just follow this trail.<END>

<NL>
There are poisonous fiends in the forest.<NL>
Be on your guard!<END>

<NL>
We [Crusader]s are training for<NL>
the upcoming operation.<NL>
Call on us if you see any [sinspawn].<END>

<NL>
Are you okay? Don't be so reckless!<NL>
Sometimes it's best to just go around it.<END>

<NL>
Fiends are everywhere.<NL>
Never let your guard down.<END>

<NL>
Every [Crusader] must pray for<NL>
the fiends' souls.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We all want the dead to find peace<NL>
on the [Farplane], right?<END>

<NL>
Good day, guardians!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Many fiends have been sighted<NL>
in areas attacked by [Sin].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Please be careful on your journey.<END>
