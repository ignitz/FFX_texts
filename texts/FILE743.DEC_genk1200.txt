Wait until shoopuf wake up?<END>

<NL>
Seems you destroyed the [Al Bhed2]'s<NL>
machina. That's some dedication.<NL>
You'll receive a blessing from [Yevon2].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It'll be necessary to strengthen security so<NL>
that the [Al Bhed] won't get their way anymore.<END>

<NL>
The [Al Bhed2] hide their green eyes<NL>
with goggles. They're known to<NL>
resort to petty tricks like that.<END>

<NL>
[Sin] took my daughter, but I just saw<NL>
her again for the first time in five years.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
That [Guadosalam] place was amazing.<END>

<NL>
I've seen my daughter, so I have no regrets.<NL>
I'm ready for the [Farplane] anytime now.<END>

<NL>
After seeing my dead daughter again,<NL>
I felt complete and free of any worry.<END>

<NL>
The wedding will be an absolute joy. It's good<NL>
to be able to experience all this, I tell you.<END>

<NL>
I thought I was lucky not to run into any<NL>
wily merchants on this side of the shore.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But I ended up buying something<NL>
from that man over there.<END>

<NL>
His goods are cheaper than the other merchants',<NL>
but he seems kind of suspicious.<END>

<NL>
Everyone seems happy.<NL>
Did something good happen?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
[Sin] might arrive any time now and<NL>
everyone just seems so laid back.<END>

<NL>
People want to forget their anxiety about [Sin],<NL>
so they absorb themselves in festivities.<END>

<NL>
The [Al Bhed2] seem docile nowadays,<NL>
but it always pays to be cautious.<END>

<NL>
I believe that an [Al Bhed2] conspiracy<NL>
is behind all the chaos in the temple.<END>

<NL>
An [Al Bhed2] ship is<NL>
battling [Sin], right?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm certain it's a ploy to win<NL>
favor with the temple!<END>

<NL>
Even if the [Al Bhed2] do something nice,<NL>
I can't bring myself to trust them.<END>

<NL>
My wife and I ran away<NL>
from [Bevelle].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I thought we could forget the terror of [Sin]<NL>
if we lived in the heart of [Yevon2]...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Boy, was I wrong.<END>

<NL>
I've expended all my energy coming here<NL>
and I can't run any farther.<END>

<NL>
If I could ride the flying ship,<NL>
I'm sure I could get back in a jiffy. <END>

<NL>
I've expended all my energy coming here<NL>
and I can't run any farther.<END>

<NL>
We're hoping to return to<NL>
our hometown of [Kilika].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
First we must cross the [Moonflow], pass<NL>
through [Djose], then travel the<NL>
[Mushroom Rock Road] and the [Mi'ihen Highroad]...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
After that, it's onto the [S.S. Winno]...<NL>
Phew! There's a long way to go, isn't there?<END>

<NL>
I wonder how long it'll<NL>
take to reach our hometown?<END>

<NL>
We were lucky we left<NL>
[Bevelle] in a hurry.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If we'd waited much longer to get out,<NL>
we would've been killed by [Sin].<END>

<NL>
This area may also become a battlefield...<NL>
Perhaps it's better to run farther away?<END>
