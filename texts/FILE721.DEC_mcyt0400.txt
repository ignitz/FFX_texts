This may well answer<NL>
a few questions.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Wonderful.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Will [Yuna] be all right?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Without us, no.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Where you goin'?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You saw, didn't you?<NL>
[Seymor]'s bad news!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But he's a maester!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Fine! Stay here if you want!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Come on, [Wakka].<NL>
Let's at least hear him out.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
This can't be happening.<END>

<NL>
Lord [Jyscal]... How horrifying!<NL>
I shall pretend I did not witness that.<END>

<NL>
This does not bode well.<NL>
Please be careful.<END>

<NL>
Ever since that incident involving<NL>
Lord [Seymor], I've had a hard time<NL>
sleeping at night.<END>

<NL>
Wish I'd never seen that sphere.<END>

<NL>
I can't believe what the sphere has shown!<NL>
There must be some mistake.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I shall keep the sphere safe here,<NL>
and return it to Lady [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
The temple undergoes its<NL>
own trial of faith, now.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If only a leader would appear<NL>
to restore its former glory.<END>

<NL>
In time, the [Guado2] will come<NL>
to see the light of [Yevon2], too.<END>
