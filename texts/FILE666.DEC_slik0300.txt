<NL>
Oh, what a great day!<NL>
The breeze must feel wonderful.<END>

<NL>
Wanna man the helm?<NL>
Yeah, right. Just kidding.<END>

<NL>
So you're with Lady [Yuna]?<NL>
That means you're a guardian.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Hmm... I guess I shouldn't<NL>
judge a book by its cover.<END>

<NL>
Maybe I'll go have chat with Lady [Yuna], too.<END>

<NL>
There was talk about warrior monks<NL>
coming on board to guard the ship.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But the captain declined the offer.<NL>
We can take care of ourselves, he said.<END>

<NL>
If [Sin] can't sink this ship, nothing can!<NL>
We're guaranteed a safe voyage.<END>

<NL>
There's been turmoil on shore, but it's<NL>
got nothing to do with us out here.<END>

<NL>
Even if [Sin] appears, I'll just do<NL>
my best to follow the captain's orders.<END>

<NL>
Even if it's against [Yevon2]'s teachings,<NL>
I want to sail that flying ship!<END>

<NL>
I wonder who's the captain of that<NL>
flying ship? He's probably calm and<NL>
cool like our captain.<END>

<NL>
We'll arrive in [Kilika] before nightfall.<NL>
Go on, take a nap or something.<END>

<NL>
The [S.S. Liki] is funded<NL>
by [Yevon2].<END>

<NL>
Ocean weather can be fickle, but<NL>
I doubt we'll see any storms today.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Of course, there is one thing<NL>
worse than any storm, and its<NL>
coming cannot be foretold...<END>

<NL>
The cargo that the [Crusader]s loaded<NL>
on board worries me. It better not<NL>
be anything sacrilegious.<END>

<NL>
It's a miracle this ship can still sail,<NL>
after the stomping [Sin] gave her.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But I fear some of my crew will<NL>
never recover from the ordeal.<END>

<NL>
Let's hope that the great sea will<NL>
ease the pain of a battered sailor.<END>

<NL>
The trouble in the temples has<NL>
got me worried. [Yevon2]'s support is<NL>
the only thing keeping this ship running.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
These are troubled times, I tell you,<NL>
what with [Yevon2] all shaken up.<END>

<NL>
Well, this ship's survived [Sin]!<NL>
She'll weather this, too.<END>

<NL>
We can't rely on [Yevon2]'s support<NL>
anymore. We plan to go on running<NL>
the ship on our own.<END>

<NL>
We can't let a flying ship get<NL>
away with all the glory! Our<NL>
pride as seamen is on the line!<END>
