<NL>
Lord [Braska] must be bursting with<NL>
pride up on the [Farplane]<NL>
at having such a fine daughter!<END>

<NL>
I heard the [Al Bhed] attacked you!<NL>
Are you okay?<END>

<NL>
I hope to celebrate Lady [Yuna]'s<NL>
Calm while I'm still alive.<END>

<NL>
How about seeing Lord [Braska]<NL>
in [Guadosalam]?<END>

<NL>
With a summoner like you at our side,<NL>
we've no need to fear [Sin]!<END>

<NL>
I'll have great stories to tell<NL>
about meeting Lady [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
Never even crossed my mind that Lady [Yuna]<NL>
would marry... Now that's a great story to tell!<END>

<NL>
You know that machina that lifts you up<NL>
to the shoopuf? I don't like it, I tell you.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I don't care if it's been approved by the temple.<NL>
Machina is machina. That's that.<END>

<NL>
Even sanctioned machina gives<NL>
me the creeps, I tell you.<END>

<NL>
I tell you, my wife was as pretty as<NL>
Lady [Yuna] back in her day.<END>

<NL>
When Lady [Yuna] gets married, will<NL>
she abandon her quest to vanquish [Sin]?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
That is what worries me the most.<END>

<NL>
I'm afraid I'll be attacked<NL>
by [Al Bhed] if I travel alone.<END>

<NL>
I think the temple should crack down<NL>
on the [Al Bhed] and teach them a lesson or two!<END>

<NL>
Have you seen the [Crusader]s returning home?<NL>
They look pathetic.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
And they were so confident<NL>
the last time they passed through.<END>

<NL>
It should be a big ceremony because<NL>
a maester's getting married.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's been so long since we've<NL>
had some good news! This is all so exciting!<END>

<NL>
So that's Lady [Yuna]?<NL>
Hmmm... No wonder.<END>

<NL>
I can see why the [Al Bhed2] would<NL>
go after someone like Lady [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
It'll be busy with all the wedding<NL>
preparations. I'd better get on my feet.<END>

<NL>
Please watch after Lady [Yuna]<NL>
until her wedding day.<END>

<NL>
I told my relatives on the [Farplane]<NL>
that I'll be joining them soon.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Now I won't be afraid if<NL>
[Sin] comes for me.<END>

<NL>
The [Guado] all looked so<NL>
gloomy. I wonder what happened?<END>

<NL>
I feel at ease now, thanks to the Hymn.<NL>
Now I can go to the [Farplane]<NL>
without worry.<END>

<NL>
The [Guado] all looked so<NL>
gloomy. I wonder what happened?<END>

<NL>
The people of [Spira] are in a<NL>
state of chaos, but the Hypello are so calm.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They're a fearless bunch.<NL>
You can only admire them.<END>

<NL>
If only Lady [Yunalesca] were here now,<NL>
we wouldn't have to live in fear of [Sin].<END>

<NL>
Who is using ancient machina<NL>
to battle [Sin]?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Could it be that Lady [Yunalesca]<NL>
has risen again after a thousand years?<END>

<NL>
We beat [Sin] down with machina and the Hymn!<NL>
A summoner just needs to finish it off!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Looks like we're<NL>
stuck here for a while.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Might be more [Al Bhed]!<NL>
Keep watch, ya?<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] fail as guardian on shoopuf.<NL>
[Kimahri] never fail again.<END>
