Gathering data for travellers is an important<NL>
part of a Crusader's duties, too.<END>

<NL>
I admire that young Crusader's dedication.<NL>
I must recruit him into the warrior monks.<END>

<NL>
The operation will commence soon.<NL>
I must hurry.<END>

<NL>
I've configured this monitor to display<NL>
information on fiends roaming around the<NL>
[Luca] area.<END>

<NL>
Once you leave Luca, you'll have to travel<NL>
the long and winding <Cor 88>[Mi'ihen Highroad]<Cor 41>.<NL>
Watch out for fiends along the way!<END>

<NL>
You should check the sphere monitor before you<NL>
set out. You'll find useful information in there.<END>

<NL>
Travellers check this monitor for fiend<NL>
information before setting out on their journey.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's our duty as [Crusader]s to collect<NL>
this kind of information.<END>

<NL>
The Hymn of the Fayth is one of our<NL>
favorites! We all sang really loud!<END>

<NL>
Enjoy the beautiful music!<NL>
Immerse yourself in the stunning visuals!<END>

<NL>
I believe the Calm is right around the corner.<NL>
Shall we celebrate early?<END>

<NL>
I suggest you proceed to the rear<NL>
for a thorough explanation.<END>

<NL>
When Sin and the ship come flying through,<NL>
listen to my drum and sing in tune!<END>

<NL>
If it's our music you want to hear,<NL>
then go to the back and buy a sphere!<END>

<NL>
That drummer lookss like ush...<NL>
Maybe he'sh a big relative of Hypello?<END>

<NL>
Thish ishn't the shtadium...?<NL>
I shink I'm losht.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Hello, there!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, weren't you in prison?<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Nah, those monks<NL>
are pushovers, I tell ye!<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
I'll fleece any priest,<NL>
or my name's not [O'aka]!<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sorry.<NL>
It was our fault they locked you up.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
No problem!<NL>
Anything for a customer, eh?<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
You know...<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
I had a sister.<NL>
[Wantz]'s older sister, you see.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
A summoner, she was.<NL>
Went on pilgrimage at a young age.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
And that was it.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Me and [Wantz], well, neither of us<NL>
were fighters enough to be guardians.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
I think about it every day, I do.<NL>
If we could've helped her.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Least I can do is try to<NL>
help another summoner, I figure.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
And Lady [Yuna],<NL>
she looks so much like...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Eh?<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
It's nothing.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Say, thanks.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[O'aka]<NL>
[Wantz] has got all the good stuff.<NL>
[O'aka] XXIII's retiring!<END>
