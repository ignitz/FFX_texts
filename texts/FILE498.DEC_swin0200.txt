[Tidus]<NL>
What are you all talking about?<END>

Bickson<NL>
Who are you supposed to be?<END>

Graav<NL>
Ah, I remember him.<NL>
Guy from Kilika.<END>

Bickson<NL>
Hmm?<END>

Graav<NL>
You know, one of the [Besaid Aurochs].<NL>
Said somethin' about winning the cup.<END>

Bickson<NL>
Oh, right.<NL>
You're that idiot.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Don't call him that!<END>

Bickson<NL>
But he is an idiot.<END>

Bickson<NL>
They don't got what<NL>
it takes to win the cup.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, they do now that I'm here!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes, they will win!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
He used to be the star player<NL>
of the [Zanarkand Abes]!<END>

Bickson<NL>
That so? Then you're the<NL>
star of a team of one.<END>

Graav<NL>
Yeah, as if anyone<NL>
lived in those ruins.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's not ruins, there's a<NL>
big city there! There is!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I-I got too close to [Sin] and--<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
There is a city, really!<END>

Bickson<NL>
Right. Whatever<NL>
Your Ladyship says.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's wrong? You seemed<NL>
kinda mad back there.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
They were being rude and...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I do believe your Zanarkand<NL>
exists. I really do, you know!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How come? <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sir [Jecht] used to<NL>
always tell me stories.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It'd be great to<NL>
see your home someday.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'd love to go there.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah.<END>

<NL>
So, [Yuna], wanna come<NL>
over to my place?<END>

<NL>
Right, sure... As if I<NL>
had a place to show her.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Well? Say something.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You'll take responsibility?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Relax! He's bound to<NL>
know someone in Luca.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
And if not?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He could always join a blitz team.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Anyhow, it's better than<NL>
just leaving him in Besaid! <END>

[Lulu]<NL>
What? Just leaving him in Luca?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What do you want me to do?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna] wants to<NL>
make him a guardian.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Oh yeah, geez...<NL>
There's that too, eh?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
And whose fault is that?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Not mine!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It is mine, huh?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why do you think she wants<NL>
to make him a guardian, anyway?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Because he's Sir [Jecht]'s son.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Oh, right.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Wait, you sure 'bout that?<NL>
He's really Sir [Jecht]'s son?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
It's hard to say, but<NL>
[Yuna] seems to believe so.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Okay.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
"Okay?" "Okay?"<NL>
That's all you have to say?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Well, yeah, I mean...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He's gotta decide for himself, ya?<NL>
Well, him and [Yuna], I guess.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You're right, for once.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Ahem!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I wonder which is best...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Why don't you tell him he should?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Should what?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Become [Yuna]'s guardian.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why me?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Because [Yuna] can't.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why not?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
He hates his father--<NL>
what he was, what he did.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Do you really think she<NL>
can possibly say to him...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
"I want you to be my guardian,<NL>
like your father was to mine?"<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Aren't you being over-sensitive?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
All right, all right.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I'll try talking to him<NL>
after the tournament.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Be discreet.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I know.<NL>
It's his decision.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He doesn't like his father?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Apparently.<NL>
He told [Yuna] as much.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hating your own father, huh?<NL>
Sounds like a luxury to me.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I don't even remember my parents.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Can't say how I feel about 'em.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I...I was five then,<NL>
so I remember mine a little.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Dammit!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Sin] just takes<NL>
everything away from us.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I'm sorry. I need<NL>
some time to think.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Go to bed, bud.<NL>
Tournament starts tomorrow morning.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Someone's bound to recognize you<NL>
when they see your moves out there.<END>

Whoa! What's that called?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Doesn't have a name.<NL>
Anyone can do it if they try.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Show us one more time, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I knew it! I knew you<NL>
were somethin' special!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
That was the [Jecht] Shot, wasn't it?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You tried to do a [Jecht] Shot, right?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How do you know that?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sir [Jecht] showed it to<NL>
me when I was a child.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
He called it the "Sublimely<NL>
Magnificent [Jecht] Shot Mark III." <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Stupid name, huh?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You know what? There is no<NL>
Mark I or Mark II, you know?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
My old man said the name Mark III<NL>
was just something to hook the crowd.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
He said they'd come back every night<NL>
expecting to see Mark I and Mark II.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And, they really did come back.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I used to get so mad.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Is he alive, you think?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I don't know.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But, Sir [Jecht] was<NL>
my father's guardian.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So he's famous here, too?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
So if anything happened to him,<NL>
I should think word would get around fast.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh-huh.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What would you do,<NL>
if you found him?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Who knows? I thought<NL>
he died ten years ago.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'd probably just smack him one.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
After everything he put<NL>
Mom and me through.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And because he was<NL>
famous, I was always...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, you should know, [Yuna].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Your father's famous, too.<NL>
Everyone in Spira knows him, right? <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Ain't it tough?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It is hard to follow in his<NL>
footsteps, as a summoner.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, there wasn't much to honor<NL>
about my old man, that's for sure.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You shouldn't say<NL>
that about your father!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I got the right!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I guess you do.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Show me that move again!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hey! It's past your<NL>
bedtime, kiddos!<END>

<NL>
I didn't think my old<NL>
man would come to Luca.<END>

<NL>
He never did like watching<NL>
other people play.<END>

<NL>
But I couldn't help feeling something<NL>
bad was gonna happen. And these<NL>
feelings of mine are usually right.<END>

<NL>
Sure, I had told [Wakka] I'd help him<NL>
win the tournament. But I wasn't sure<NL>
I had it in me to play at all anymore.<END>

<NL>
The [Aurochs] are the<NL>
team to watch this year.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They say they got a blitzer from<NL>
[Zanarkand] on their team!<END>

<NL>
Oh, come on! You actually<NL>
believe that rumor?<END>

<NL>
Ha! No way. I only meant<NL>
it'll be fun to watch.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The best? Yeah, right.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sure.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But the honor of having a father<NL>
like him surpasses all that, I think.<END>

Datto<NL>
Looks like the toxin's still getting to you.<NL>
Take it easy and go to bed early, ya?<END>

Datto<NL>
We wanted to have our final practice<NL>
in [Kilika], but that's impossible<NL>
after what happened to the place.<END>

Datto<NL>
I feel a little nervous with<NL>
Lady [Yuna] watching us, ya?<END>

Datto<NL>
Yeow... I-I hurt my back.<END>

Letty<NL>
[Wakka] is busy right now.<NL>
Maybe you shouldn't bother him.<END>

Letty<NL>
Let's pray we don't have to go<NL>
against the Goers until the finals!<END>

Letty<NL>
Is Datto alright? It's right<NL>
before the big game and all.<END>

Letty<NL>
That was one amazing shot you just did!<NL>
They don't call you an ace for nothin'.<END>

Jassu<NL>
We can finally relax now that<NL>
the Goers are down in the cabin.<END>

Jassu<NL>
Don't mind [Kimahri] for not answering you.<NL>
He's the silent type, you know?<END>

Jassu<NL>
I'm gonna tell Botta and Keepa<NL>
all about that shot you just did.<NEWPAGE>
Jassu<NL>
They'll be so mad when they<NL>
find out what they missed!<END>

Jassu<NL>
I'm glad the Goers weren't here to see it.<NL>
Let's keep it secret until the finals!<END>

<NL>
The [Aurochs] are getting too<NL>
hyped up before the match.<END>

<NL>
You can practice in the water all you<NL>
like, but the ship isn't going to wait.<END>

<NL>
What a bunch of reckless guys.<NL>
You want to swim to [Luca] or something?<END>

<NL>
Put yourself in my shoes.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Everyone always blames the<NL>
crew when ships are late.<END>

<NL>
The [Luca] Goers fans will beat<NL>
the pulp out of us if that happens.<END>

<NL>
Everyone in [Luca] is a Goers fan.<NL>
Watch your backs--you're on enemy ground.<END>

<NL>
I loved that crazy stunt you [Aurochs]<NL>
pulled back there. Good luck in the game.<END>

<NL>
You're a blitzer from [Zanarkand], right?<NL>
At least put up a good fight, you hear me?<END>

<NL>
That guy poking around back there<NL>
is taking sphere shots of Lady [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
You should go rest. You're gonna drown<NL>
during the match if you're sleep-deprived.<END>

<NL>
We've got important guests onboard, so don't<NL>
interfere with our jobs. You got that?<NL>
<END>

<NL>
Our guests this trip are nothing but trouble,<NL>
not to mention those excommunicated [Crusader]s!<END>

<NL>
[Zanarkand], eh...?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If you're going to bluff at all, say<NL>
something a little more believable.<END>

<NL>
You've got nerve to say you're from [Zanarkand].<NL>
