[Rikku]<NL>
[Yunie]!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You're all right?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
We were so worried!<NL>
It's good to have you back!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thank you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Um...<NL>
I...uh...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Kinoc]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why, you!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I have saved him.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
He was a man who craved power.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
And great power he had,<NL>
but he feared losing it.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Trembling at unseen enemies,<NL>
he spent his days scheming<NL>
petty schemes.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Chased by his fears,<NL>
never knowing rest.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
You see...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Now, he has no worries.<NL>
He has been granted sleep eternal.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Death is a sweet slumber.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
All the pain of life is gently<NL>
swept away... Ah, yes.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
So you see...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
if all life were to end<NL>
in [Spira], all suffering<NL>
would end. Don't you see?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Do you not agree?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
That, [Yuna], is why I need you.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Come, Lady [Yuna].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Come with me to [Zanarkand],<NL>
the lost city of the dead.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
With death on our side,<NL>
we will save [Spira],<NL>
and for this...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I will take from you your<NL>
strength, [Yuna], your life,<NL>
and become the next [Sin].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I will destroy [Spira]!<NL>
I will save it!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You're totally nuts!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Unpleasant...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Very well.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I will give you your death.<NL>
You seem to want it so.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Run! Protect [Yuna]!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Go!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No way!<NL>
I'm fighting!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I said go!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I won't leave [Kimahri] behind!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
He is a guardian.<NL>
Protecting you is everything.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Auron]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
That's right!<NL>
We're all guardians!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, and you know what that means?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna]...<NL>
Anywhere you go, I'll follow!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Anywhere I go?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, anywhere!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Well, then!<END>

[Tidus] & [Yuna]<NL>
Let's go!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, [Kimahri]!<NL>
Leave some for us!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hey! Wait for me!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Me, too!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I'll go, too!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Run!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Man, don't these guys ever give up?<END>

<NL>
Infidel!<END>

<NL>
You'll regret showing your<NL>
face here! We'll strike you<NL>
down in the name of [Yevon2]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Blah, blah, blah.<NL>
Yeah, so? Guys?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
If they want a fight,<NL>
let's give 'em one!<END>

<NL>
Prepare to charge!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Stop!<END>

<NL>
Captain?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Lady [Yuna] is not to be harmed!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
She's no traitor!<NL>
That is an evil rumor<NL>
spread by the [Al Bhed]!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
What?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Maester [Mika] himself told me.<END>

<NL>
Then...what are we to do?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Stand down!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
As she says!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
What was that<NL>
about evil [Al Bhed]?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I... Truly, I do not<NL>
understand it myself.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
All [Yevon2] seems to be<NL>
in a state of confusion.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Why, yesterday they called me<NL>
out of the blue and made me<NL>
captain of the guard!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Short on believers?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Yes, the chaos in the temples<NL>
is worse than I'd imagined.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
It's horrible!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
And all the priests do<NL>
is blame each other.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I worry what will become of [Yevon2].<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
But no!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I must be the rock that stands<NL>
against the swirling tides, right?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Lady [Yuna], I must tell you,<NL>
your courage has been a great<NL>
inspiration to me.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, that's great, but we<NL>
came here to see [Maester Mika].<NL>
Is he here?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Yes, I shall<NL>
arrange an audience.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Please wait in the courtroom.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Hey, hey, wait!<NL>
What was all that about<NL>
the [Al Bhed] lying and stuff?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Simple.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Yuna] has become<NL>
[Mika]'s only hope.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Oh... Okay.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Just what does he think<NL>
he can get away with?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Time to teach him some manners!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes, let's.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Hold there!<NL>
This bridge is closed.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
[Bevelle] is off limits by the<NL>
temple's decree. No one may enter.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Pacce]<NL>
Everyone's in mourning<NL>
since [Maester Mika] died...<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
And it's been morning for days now!<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
[Pacce]...<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
At least, that's what they say.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
The temple's falling apart<NL>
with all four maesters gone.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
They're afraid of riots,<NL>
so they're turning everyone away.<NL>
With our brother in the middle...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's up with [Isaaru]?<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
They came crying to him to<NL>
stay in [Bevelle], to protect<NL>
the temple and all that.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
And you know our brother.<NL>
It's not in him to refuse.<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
Oh, I guess our pilgrimage<NL>
is done, then, huh?<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Of course not! Geez...<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Long story short...<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
You'll only find trouble in [Bevelle].<NL>
I'd stay out for your own safety.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
That whole bit about [Yuna] being<NL>
a traitor's just some [Al Bhed]<NL>
rumor, I hear.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
I just can't believe it.<NL>
I mean, the [Al Bhed] helped us out!<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Wait all you want.<NL>
[Bevelle]'s gates are closed.<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
[Isaaru] sends his<NL>
regards to Lady [Yuna].<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
And...he says he's sorry, too.<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
I heard something funny the other day.<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
If a flying ship sings,<NL>
we're supposed to sing along!<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
And they say that will beat [Sin]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Better not go near the temple.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No use praying now anyway.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
You're quite popular these days, eh?<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Anything you want, I've got it!<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Traitor or no, Lady [Yuna]'s<NL>
always been a friend to [O'aka].<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Now's the time to<NL>
make good your escape!<END>
