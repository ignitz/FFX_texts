[Lucil]<NL>
We've been expecting you.<NL>
Please proceed to the command center.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
The presence of a maester<NL>
and a summoner is great<NL>
for the troops' morale--<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
myself included. Thank you<NL>
for being here, my lady.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Depending on the way things turn<NL>
out, we might suffer casualties.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
In such an event, we would<NL>
be grateful if you could<NL>
perform the sending, my lady.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
We may have to fight here,<NL>
as well. Stay alert.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Lady Summoner!<NL>
What are you doing here?<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Well, with your guardians near you<NL>
shouldn't have anything to worry about.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Don't say we shouldn't be<NL>
using machina! Not now, please?<END>

[Elma]<NL>
I hope Captain [Lucil] notices<NL>
my efforts in this mission!<END>

<NL>
There is increasing fiend activity.<NL>
This may not be much help, but...<END>

<NL>
A summoner's entourage!<NL>
Please accept this.<END>

<NL>
After the operation, my compadres and I<NL>
are heading straight to [Luca].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's gonna be a blast. We've already<NL>
reserved a place and everything.<END>

<NL>
Do you think [Yevon2] will take<NL>
us back in if we succeed?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
In the end, I wasn't able<NL>
to stop them, as you can see.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
But seeing their fierce determination,<NL>
I couldn't just sit there.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
So I decided that I would do<NL>
everything in my power to help them.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Truly, I know nothing of<NL>
the ways of fighting, but<NL>
I do know some white magic.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I'm hoping that will be<NL>
of some use to them.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Is there anything I can<NL>
do to help you?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Take care!<END>
