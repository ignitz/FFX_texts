Datto<NL>
Victory! Victory! We're taking home<NL>
that cup, no matter what it takes, ya?<END>

Datto<NL>
Yaaah!<END>

Datto<NL>
Haaah!<END>

Datto<NL>
Arrrgh!<END>

Datto<NL>
Victory will be ours!<END>

Letty<NL>
Should I practice kick passes too?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Yeah.<NL>
<CHOICE2>No, you're fine.<END>

Letty<NL>
Okay, I'll pretend I'm<NL>
kicking with my hands!<END>

Letty<NL>
Right on!<END>

Letty<NL>
I'm gonna sharpen my hand skills!<END>

Jassu<NL>
I'm so tired of practicing passes.<NL>
I wanna do some shooting, too!<END>

Jassu<NL>
He's really bad at kicking.<NEWPAGE>
Jassu<NL>
And I always end up having<NL>
to practice with him.<NEWPAGE>
Jassu<NL>
But what can you do, ya?<END>

<NL>
Huh? You want to<NL>
use the binoculars?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Yes.<NL>
<CHOICE2>No, not really.<END>

<NL>
No way. Remember what<NL>
you did last time?<END>

<NL>
I see.<END>

<NL>
For both father and daughter<NL>
to become summoners--it must<NL>
have been [Yevon2]'s will.<END>

<NL>
If anyone can defeat [Sin]<NL>
the daughter of Lord [Braska] can!<END>

<NL>
Please take good care of yourself.<NL>
Just remember that your well-being<NL>
means a lot to us.<END>

Letty<NL>
Man, I wish we were<NL>
half as popular as [Yuna].<END>

Jassu<NL>
Hey, don't let it get to you.<NL>
It's the same as always, ya?<END>

<NL>
Can I have a sphere taken with you?<NL>
Or maybe just an autograph?<END>

Datto<NL>
Someday we'll earn some<NL>
respect, just like [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
A summoner's confident smile is<NL>
always a great encouragement to us.<END>

<NL>
Yay!<END>

<NL>
Yahoo! A flying ship!!<END>

<NL>
Yippee!<END>

<NL>
Hey! Stop that!<END>

<NL>
Just watch what your big<NL>
sis is doing and learn!<END>

<NL>
How long do you think you've been<NL>
doing that? Stop it right now!<END>

<NL>
Okay, okay. I see it, so can you<NL>
just calm down for a change?<END>

<NL>
Hey, come down here.<END>

<NL>
What are you so happy about?<END>

<NL>
Oh, all right, all right.<NL>
Happy, happy! Goody, goody!<END>

<NL>
Why are we so quiet,<NL>
all of a sudden?<END>

<NL>
Since that strange shadow<NL>
swept across the sky, my little<NL>
pet won't come down anymore.<END>

<NL>
Come on down!<NL>
We don't bite!<END>

<NL>
Wow! I just saw a real flying ship!<NL>
I thought I was dreaming again!<END>

<NL>
Hey, how long are you gonna be<NL>
up there? There aren't going to be<NL>
any more ships flying by!<END>

<NL>
The [S.S. Liki] is funded<NL>
by [Yevon2].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It doesn't cost a single Gil, even when<NL>
I take my dogs on board with me.<END>

<NL>
Do you like dogs?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I just adore them.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Good boy. Good boy.<END>

<NL>
It's been so nice travelling with<NL>
my dog... I wish we could go<NL>
on forever.<END>

<NL>
I pray that the elders of [Yevon2]<NL>
can keep peace in [Spira].<END>

<NL>
That flying ship's bad news!<END>

<NL>
Ships aren't supposed to fly!<NL>
It's frightened my precious dogs!<END>

<NL>
Hey, you. You were on the ship<NL>
when [Sin] attacked us, right?<END>

<NL>
I've been afraid of the<NL>
sea ever since then.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm so afraid it'll come back<NL>
I can't even concentrate on my work!<END>

<NL>
I should probably find a<NL>
new job on land somewhere.<END>

<NL>
They put me on watch duty, since<NL>
I can't handle my old post anymore.<END>

<NL>
Whenever I'm on watch, I keep<NL>
thinking that [Sin]'s gonna come<NL>
back for us.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I-I can't stop shaking.<NL>
Oh, I'm so pathetic.<END>

<NL>
I thought the sea breeze would help<NL>
cure [Sin]'s toxin, but no luck so far.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I keep seeing [Sin] attacking us again.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I...I just can't seem to get<NL>
[Sin] out of my head! Arrgh!<END>

<NL>
I can't call myself a sailor like this.<NL>
Maybe I should leave the ship and go<NL>
on a pilgrimage.<END>

<NL>
Once [Sin] is defeated, I won't have<NL>
to be afraid of the sea anymore.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I can return to my old seadog self again.<END>

<NL>
If I pray for anything, it's<NL>
going to be for those guys on<NL>
the flying ship to defeat [Sin]!<END>

<NL>
When I die, I want to have a grand<NL>
sending to the [Farplane].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Hmm. I'll ask them to reserve the<NL>
[Luca Stadium] for the ceremony.<END>

<NL>
I wouldn't mind having a bevy of<NL>
young maidens crying their hearts<NL>
out for me, either.<END>

<NL>
Well, it'll probably be a long time<NL>
before I'm sent to the [Farplane], though.<END>

<NL>
Whatever came of that rumor about<NL>
the high summoner's daughter<NL>
marrying the lord maester?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Hmm, so it was called off, huh?<NL>
Too bad.<END>

<NL>
Every story you hear<NL>
lately is so depressing.<END>

<NL>
When the [Calm] comes, we'll be<NL>
able to truly enjoy blitzball.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Dangit. Maybe I retired too soon.<END>

<NL>
Even the greatest champions<NL>
must retire sometime. The same<NL>
must be true of [Sin].<END>

<NL>
I brought these children along<NL>
to teach them how to become<NL>
merchants, but all they do is play!<END>

<NL>
Once little kids learn something fun,<NL>
they just repeat it over and over.<END>

<NL>
The kids found a new way to play.<NL>
They'll never be merchants now!<END>

<NL>
I think so too.<END>

<NL>
Don't give me such nonsense.<END>

<NL>
Just watching those two<NL>
made me a little envious.<END>

<NL>
Did you know that the<NL>
warrior monks raided [Besaid Island]?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They said they were<NL>
searching for traitors.<END>

<NL>
The people of [Besaid] refused<NL>
to tell them anything.<END>

<NL>
I sang at the top of my lungs<NL>
when I saw the flying ship...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But I wonder if singing in the<NL>
middle of the ocean did any good?<END>

<NL>
All we can do now is<NL>
pray for [Sin] to go away.<END>

<NL>
My husband used to be a pro<NL>
blitzer, and I was his goalie.<END>

<NL>
Whether in a tournament or in<NL>
life, we're the best partners.<END>

<NL>
My husband was the best<NL>
blitzer in the league.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Even Bickson of the [Luca Goers] wouldn't<NL>
have stood a chance against him.<END>

<NL>
Seems like there was trouble<NL>
in [Bevelle]. Oh dear,<NL>
I wonder what has happened?<END>

<NL>
My husband used to be a blitzer.<NL>
He kept playing right into his golden years!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But he could take down blitzers<NL>
only half his age. It's true!<END>

<NL>
I was one of those young blitzers once...<NL>
I'll leave the rest up to your imagination!<END>

<NL>
Ever since [Sin] got to him, my partner<NL>
has turned into a gutless wonder.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He used to be so dependable, but now he just<NL>
stares into the sea with terror in his eyes.<END>

<NL>
[Sin]'s toxin probably got to him.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I hope the cool sea breeze<NL>
cures him soon...<END>

<NL>
Ever since [Sin] attacked us, my<NL>
shipmate has been terrified of the sea.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I can't believe it. I mean, he's lived<NL>
by the sea since he was a kid...<END>

<NL>
[Sin]'s toxin turned<NL>
him into a coward.<END>

<NL>
He's perked up a little seeing<NL>
that flying ship battling [Sin].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Once [Sin] is gone, he'll<NL>
probably get back to normal.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
Thank god for that flying ship.<NL>
Now that's the blessing of [Yevon2]!<END>

<NL>
Go ahead and rest down below.<NL>
We'll be there by the time you wake up.<END>

<NL>
Word is that summoner's<NL>
got noble blood!<END>

<NL>
I heard she's Lord [Braska]'s daughter!<END>

<NL>
Ya don't say?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Lord [Braska]'s...daughter?<END>

<NL>
Lord [Braska]'s daughter?<NL>
She just might have a chance!<END>

<NL>
We'll get her to [Kilika], we will!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
She does have a name,<NL>
you know... [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
Hmm? Lady [Yuna]?<END>

<NL>
Well then, we pray for<NL>
Lady [Yuna]'s safe passage!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Come to think of it, I haven't<NL>
told you where we're going!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
First to <Cor 88>[Kilika]<Cor 41> Island, then we<NL>
change boats and head for Luca.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
'Fore that, though, [Yuna]'s gotta<NL>
pray at the temple. I'll be guarding.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We'll be praying for the [Aurochs]'<NL>
victory, too, so you come along, ya?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Great plan.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hey, it is a great plan!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Don't look at me!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, is [Yuna]'s father<NL>
famous or something?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
She's the daughter of<NL>
[High Summoner Braska]!<NL>
You saw his statue at the temple.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Lord [Braska] defeated [Sin] ten years ago.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Yuna]'s the heir to a great legacy!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's tough when<NL>
your father's famous.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Wakka]'s...a bit lacking<NL>
in the imagination department.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Thanks, [Lulu],<NL>
I'll keep that in mind.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Oh yeah, you talk to [Yuna] yet?<NL>
She had some questions for you.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I don't know who you are,<NL>
or where you came from.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
If you interfere with [Yuna]'s<NL>
pilgrimage, we won't take it lightly.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Nice to see you again!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You! You really<NL>
quit the knights?<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Yeah, I did.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
[Elma] was upset with me,<NL>
but Captain [Lucil] understood.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Now, I'm working as a<NL>
chocobo breeder on this ship.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I really, really love<NL>
taking care of chocobos!<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Being with chocobos all the time...<NL>
I think I've found my calling!<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
And it's all thanks<NL>
to you! Thank you!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, I'm happy for you.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Oh, yeah!<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I found this in one of the<NL>
chocobo nests the other day.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
It's no use to me, so<NL>
I want you to have it.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Ah, I have to go now.<NL>
It's time for lunch.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, I want to talk to you some more.<NL>
Can't your stomach wait?<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I meant I have to feed the chocobos.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
They get really upset<NL>
if they're not fed!<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
See you!<END>

<NL>
Hey, can you believe this!?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>What?<NL>
<CHOICE2>No, bye.<END>

<NL>
I just saw this merchant guy<NL>
inside the ship, and guess<NL>
what he said to me?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He walked up to me and said,<NL>
"You're no good!" Just like that!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Isn't that awful?<NL>
I've still got style! I'll show him!<END>

<NL>
Don't you think so, too?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Yeah.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Well...<END>

<NL>
That's right. I knew I was right.<NL>
He doesn't know what he's talking about!<END>

<NL>
You men are all alike!<NL>
Get away from me!<END>

<NL>
You could at least<NL>
pretend to listen!<END>

<NL>
It makes me so mad.<NL>
I'm not going inside anymore!<END>

<NL>
I wonder if they're related?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>I'd say they're related.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Looks like they're married.<END>

Going to rest now?<END>
