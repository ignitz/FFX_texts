[Yuna]<NL>
Sir [Auron].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Kimahri] told me...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
when my father wanted me taken<NL>
from [Bevelle] to [Besaid]...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It was you who told [Kimahri], right?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I had always wanted<NL>
to meet you someday.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I am truly glad that<NL>
I had that chance.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Having you as a guardian was<NL>
so great an honor I don't know<NL>
how to thank you.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Perhaps if I defeat [Sin],<NL>
that will be my thanks to you.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
That's what I'll do.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes. I will challenge [Sin].<NL>
I will defeat [Sin].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
If you are all there watching this,<NL>
then I guess [Sin] is already gone.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And so am I, I suppose.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Anyway, I just wanted to say:<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sir [Auron], I thank you.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Kimahri]...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Do you remember<NL>
the first day we met?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I was only seven.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
My father had defeated [Sin],<NL>
and all [Bevelle] was celebrating.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Everyone was saying what a hero<NL>
my father was. I was so happy.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But when night came,<NL>
it occurred to me.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
My father had defeated [Sin]<NL>
and now he was dead.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Now, I was all alone.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I couldn't sleep, so I wandered<NL>
into the town, away from the<NL>
celebrating crowds.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I stood on the bridge in [Bevelle]<NL>
where my father and I had parted.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Standing there, alone, I could see<NL>
the fields where he had fought [Sin].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Then, you appeared, [Kimahri].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You said you were looking for<NL>
the daughter of [Braska], remember?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
At first, I was so scared.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Until I realized what<NL>
a gentle person you are.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You weren't used to<NL>
talking to children.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
When I told you that<NL>
I was [Braska]'s daughter...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
you said you would take me as<NL>
far from [Bevelle] as you could.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
That it was the wish<NL>
of a man facing death.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I think...I cried then.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Because that...that was when<NL>
I knew my father was dead...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
and I would never see him again.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You just held me,<NL>
without saying a word.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I cried after we got<NL>
to [Besaid], too.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
When you tried to go after leaving<NL>
me in the care of the temple...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I held on to you, crying,<NL>
"Don't go, don't go!"<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And you listened, [Kimahri].<NL>
You stayed.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Kimahri], thank you.<NL>
Thank you so much.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And I've always liked<NL>
your broken horn.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Wakka], [Lulu]:<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'll never forget my days spent<NL>
with you, growing up in [Besaid].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
We always played together,<NL>
us and [Chappu].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
That's why I was always<NL>
so happy, I think.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And when you refused to let me<NL>
become a summoner and I did it anyway...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I've always wanted to apologize.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You know, when you tried to stop<NL>
me then--really, I was happy.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I could tell you<NL>
really cared about me.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You were like my<NL>
big brother and sister.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
No...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I think you really were<NL>
my big brother and sister.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What else...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I love watching you<NL>
play [blitzball], [Wakka].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I even love it when you<NL>
scold me, [Lulu]! Really!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
We haven't even known each<NL>
other that long, but...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's funny.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
So this is what it feels like.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's a much more wonderful feeling<NL>
than anything I had ever imagined.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Wonderful...but it hurts, sometimes.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I wonder.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
No, I shouldn't say that.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'll do that part over.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Um...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whatcha up to?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I guess that leaves...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
the newest guardian.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Star player of the [Zanarkand Abes]!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You are...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I am...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Well, um...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm glad...I'm glad that we met.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I...I just want to say,<NL>
thank you for everything.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Maybe...maybe that's why it hurts.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
When I... When I think about us<NL>
never being together again at all...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm afraid.<END>
