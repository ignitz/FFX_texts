<NL>
The warrior monk? She's not around<NL>
anymore. I missed my chance at her.<END>

<NL>
I asked a warrior monk out to the cafe,<NL>
but she called me a spoony bard!<NL>
Unbelievable!<END>

<NL>
Is it true that Maester<NL>
[Seymor] isn't a normal [Guado]?<END>

<NL>
I'm certain that the [Al Bhed Psyches]<NL>
are gonna win this year.<END>

<NL>
Maester Mika seemed well at the<NL>
tournament, but I guess there's<NL>
no winning against old age.<END>

<NL>
[Maester Kinoc] was always concerned<NL>
for the safety of the people.<NL>
It's a shame to have lost him.<END>

<NL>
They say there are lots of<NL>
guys who quit the [Crusader]s and<NL>
try to become [blitzball] players.<END>

<NL>
If anything had happened to [Maester Mika],<NL>
the guards would've been toast.<END>

<NL>
The opening ceremony's going to start soon!<NL>
All players must proceed to their locker rooms.<END>

<NL>
Where have the [Crusader]s been hiding?<NL>
After that battle they just disappeared...<END>

<NL>
I saw the [Luca Goers] were at dock number 3.<NL>
Man, those guys were something else!<END>

<NL>
The [Kilika Beasts] aren't advancing?<NL>
Well, there's always next year...<END>

<NL>
With me cheering for them, the<NL>
[Kilika Beasts] will win hands down!<END>

<NL>
It's going to be busy from now on!<NL>
Once the [Calm] arrives,<NL>
we're having a huge sale!<END>

<NL>
I can't do business with the<NL>
temple the way it is. I hope<NL>
they get their act together soon.<END>

<NL>
I'm thinking of a new business<NL>
that'll cater to warrior monks.<NL>
I wonder what they like?<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s are buying up everything.<NL>
Better stock up while you can.<END>

<NL>
Tournaments are when we earn our cash!<NL>
There's no time to waste now!<END>

<NL>
The defeated [Al Bhed] are now staying<NL>
at different travel agencies. <END>

<NL>
I'm all for the [Crusader]s and the [Al Bhed].<NL>
Heck, even the stadium uses machina!<END>

<NL>
The fans always celebrate after the game,<NL>
but with the fiend scare, I doubt it.<END>

<NL>
The opening ceremony is about to begin<NL>
and you're taking a walk? Now that's bold.<END>

<NL>
Whoever thought of destroying [Sin]<NL>
with a song was a genius!<END>

<NL>
I wonder how the wedding was?<NL>
Haven't heard anything from the temple yet.<END>

<NL>
With all these warrior monks,<NL>
it feels more like they're<NL>
occupying Luca than defending it.<END>

<NL>
This guy in a red robe took down<NL>
a fiend in one blow! Is that cool or what?<END>

<NL>
Hmmm... A guy in a red coat, huh?<NL>
Yeah, I saw someone like that.<NL>
Wait, maybe I didn't.<END>

<NL>
We're having a commemorative [blitzball]<NL>
tournament when the [Calm] arrives.<NL>
We want you to show up, okay? <END>

<NL>
The warrior monks left Luca without a word.<NL>
Who do they think they are?<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks seem stronger<NL>
than the [Crusader]s. I hope they'll<NL>
protect us from now on.<END>

<NL>
Cleaning up after the fiends<NL>
will be a nightmare. We'll be up<NL>
all night again repairing the stadium.<END>

<NL>
We've been up all night preparing<NL>
for the tournament, so I'm exhausted.<END>

<NL>
Hurray! With the [Crusader]s back I feel<NL>
like we could take on two [Sin]s!<END>

<NL>
Only a few have returned alive.<NL>
It's the worst defeat in [Crusader] history.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s are all taking off.<NL>
I hope they'll come back safe.<END>

<NL>
Auron? Yeah, I know him!<NL>
He was a guardian for Lord [Braska], right?<END>

<NL>
Singing together was embarrassing<NL>
at first, but once we started,<NL>
we couldn't stop.<END>

<NL>
I don't know much about religion, but<NL>
there's something weird about the temple.<END>

<NL>
With only the [Crusader]s and the<NL>
[Al Bhed] helping, no wonder we lost.<NL>
Where were the [Ronso], or the [Guado]?<END>

<NL>
[Seymor]'s aeon may<NL>
be able to destroy [Sin].<END>

<NL>
There must be a hundred people<NL>
in red out there. How am I<NL>
supposed to remember them all?<END>

<NL>
Welcome!<END>

<NL>
I've got official [blitzball] merchandise<NL>
as well as other rare items!<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Got any weapons?<NL>
<CHOICE2>Got any items?<NL>
<CHOICE3>Leave.<END>

<NL>
Come back anytime!<END>

<NL>
To tell you the truth, I doubt you can destroy<NL>
Sin with the Hymn, but you might as well try.<END>

<NL>
Not all of the [Crusader]s are armed well.<NL>
They seem inferior to the warrior monks.<END>

<NL>
The ship at dock number 3<NL>
brought lots of warrior monks<NL>
to Luca. I feel much safer now.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s may use machina<NL>
in their operation. If so, they're<NL>
no different from the [Al Bhed].<END>

<NL>
I'm so worried. What if the fiends<NL>
that appeared in the stadium find<NL>
their way into the city?<END>

<NL>
Give them a balloon and they're<NL>
happy campers. Kids are so<NL>
innocent and easy to please.<END>

<NL>
It's that child who helps me to<NL>
forget about [Sin]'s existence.<NL>
Even if it's only for a moment.<END>

<NL>
I hope the Calm arrives<NL>
soon so that this child can<NL>
live in a peaceful Spira.<END>

<NL>
My husband likes the warrior monks,<NL>
but I simply can't bear them.<END>

<NL>
What if the Crusaders just angered<NL>
Sin? What will we do then?<END>

<NL>
Most of the [Crusader]s that guard our<NL>
city have gone off to that "operation."<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
[Luca] is defenseless!<NL>
Whatever will we do if fiends appear?<END>

<NL>
I never believed that the fiends<NL>
would attack this city. This is horrible.<END>

<NL>
You'll have to excuse my child;<NL>
I've never seen her quite so lively.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Kids will be kids, I suppose.<END>

<NL>
With [Maester Mika2] also in attendance,<NL>
this tournament will go down in history.<END>

<NL>
Is Sin really going to go away?<NL>
You'd better not be lying to me.<END>

<NL>
There's a flying ship at the port!<NL>
That's a forbidden machina, isn't it?<END>

<NL>
I feel sorry for the Crusaders.<NL>
Everyone is so gloomy.<END>

<NL>
You know what? They said that the Crusaders<NL>
are bad people disobeying the teachings!<END>

<NL>
Mommy and daddy aren't very happy.<NL>
Do you know why? Hmmm?<END>

<NL>
I got a red balloon!<NL>
Bet you want one, too!<END>

<NL>
The flying ship's got everyone in<NL>
high spirits, but that's no excuse<NL>
to neglect our guard duties!<END>

<NL>
Luca is a free city. The fiends<NL>
could have snuck in from anywhere.<END>

<NL>
Luca men aren't my type.<NL>
They have to be more manly.<END>

<NL>
We're going to be closed for awhile.<NL>
The manager was badly bit by a fiend.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Serves him right for leaving me<NL>
here while he enjoys the game.<END>

<NL>
I would've gladly been attacked<NL>
by fiends just to see the game live.<END>

<NL>
The manager said he's going to the game,<NL>
so I got stuck looking after the place.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's not fair at all. I wanted to watch <NL>
the game and cheer on the Goers.<END>

<NL>
Hey, why don't you go<NL>
cheer them on for me!<END>

<NL>
Even the temple makes mistakes.<NL>
The monks are only human, after all.<END>

<NL>
Luca's so quiet now with all<NL>
the blitz fans gone home.<END>

<NL>
When the fiends first appeared in<NL>
the stadium, I thought it was the<NL>
halftime show or something.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
So I just sat and watched--when<NL>
suddenly they started rampaging.<NL>
I was shocked!<END>

<NL>
I like a good riot once in a while,<NL>
but I never want to do that again.<END>

<NL>
I hate it when this<NL>
cafe is so packed.<END>

<NL>
Every place in town is packed during<NL>
the tournament. It's a nightmare<NL>
trying to find a place to eat.<END>

<NL>
What's wrong with the temple these days?<NL>
They're hopeless when we need them most!<END>

<NL>
It's a pity about the [Crusader]s.<NL>
They were all such devoted fighters.<END>

<NL>
It's all such a big mess, and<NL>
I don't know what's going on anymore.<END>

<NL>
You were on the sphere, right?<NL>
Good luck in the game.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But I still think an [Aurochs]<NL>
victory is next to impossible.<END>

<NL>
You understand that those who<NL>
belittle [Yevon2]'s teachings will<NL>
be excommunicated, don't you?<END>

<NL>
I wonder if my brother heard<NL>
my hymn up on the [Farplane]?<END>

<NL>
I don't want to go back to [Guadosalam]<NL>
because it reminds me of my brother.<END>

<NL>
I just don't understand why Maester<NL>
[Seymor] would choose that woman<NL>
when he could have someone like me.<END>

<NL>
My brother is very strong. That's why<NL>
Maester [Seymor] depends on him.<END>

<NL>
It's Maester [Seymor] that<NL>
protected [Maester Mika2], right?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
And now, it's my brother that's<NL>
guarding Maester [Seymor]!<END>

<NL>
My brother said that he'd do absolutely<NL>
anything for Maester [Seymor].<END>

<NL>
Have you seen Maester [Seymor]?<NL>
What do you think?<NL>
He's an absolute dream, isn't he?<END>

<NL>
The [Guado] team is worked up<NL>
because Maester [Seymor] is<NL>
watching, you know!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whoa!<NL>
This is a pretty big town!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Luca is the second<NL>
largest city in [Spira].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I thought every town was little--<NL>
you know, like [Besaid] and [Kilika].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Towns don't usually<NL>
get bigger than that.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Because when a lot of<NL>
people start to gather...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Sin]...?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What about [Luca]?<NL>
It's safe here?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's not any different,<NL>
but the stadium is here.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The [Crusader]s fight to protect it<NL>
with all their strength.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
They protect the stadium?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Blitzball is really the only<NL>
entertainment that we have.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Spira]'s a little short<NL>
on fun these days.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whoa!<NL>
Talk about pressure!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
That's right!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Is [Zanarkand] like this, too?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, there are more buildings.<NL>
All tall ones and cramped together.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
They must be so tall!<NL>
Don't you ever get dizzy?<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Let's go find Sir [Auron]!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Where in Spira have you been!?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna]'s been kidnapped<NL>
by the [Al Bhed Psyches].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
In exchange for her safe return,<NL>
they want the [Aurochs] to lose.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What!?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
If they're only [blitzball] players,<NL>
I doubt they'd do anything drastic.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
But we shouldn't take chances.<NL>
Let's go get her. <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm going too!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
This will be no problem!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
They're telling the [Aurochs]<NL>
to throw the game, as if<NL>
they needed to!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I mean, how good a<NL>
team can they be?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Wakka] said the same thing.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
He'll take care of the game.<NL>
We should go get [Yuna].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The [Al Bhed] boat is in <Cor 88>dock 4<Cor 41>.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Let's go.<END>

Datto<NL>
You're really leavin', Cap'n?<END>

Letty<NL>
Shouldn't you heal up first?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Yuna] needs me with her now.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I can't be lying<NL>
around in some bed.<END>

Datto<NL>
Yeah, but...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Come on, look sharp!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
The blitz season just started.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Don't make those faces, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Well...<NL>
See you, boys!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You be good.<END>

[Aurochs]<NL>
Cap'n...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I can't hear you!<END>
