<NL>
You could at least<NL>
go see how they are doing.<END>

<NL>
Hmm...<NL>
I'm sure they're all right, ya?<END>

<NL>
But, it's been nearly...<END>

<NL>
It's been nearly a day already.<END>

<NL>
Perhaps you could go look for us.<END>

<NL>
People are searching for him now.<END>

<NL>
Thank you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Who cares whether<NL>
he comes back or not?<END>

<NL>
But he might die!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Fine, let him!<END>

<NL>
Do you...<END>

<NL>
Do you hate him so?<END>

<NL>
If he dies, you'll never be able<NL>
to tell him how much you hate him.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Well, well, trying to follow<NL>
in my footsteps, are you?<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I usually charge for<NL>
lessons, you know...<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
That shot is done...<NL>
like this!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
You can't do it, kid.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
But don't worry, my boy.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
You're not the only one.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
No one else can do it.<NL>
I'm the best!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Eesh...<NL>
Can't I get a little privacy?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Your singing reminded me<NL>
of [Spira].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, right. You're not originally<NL>
from [Zanarkand], are you?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You homesick?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Maybe.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Zanarkand]...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You homesick, too?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
That's not your world anymore.<NL>
You're [Sin] now.<END>
