My husband has long served as a guardian<NL>
to the leaders of the [Guado].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
These days he accompanies Lord [Seymor]<NL>
all over [Spira].<END>

<NL>
We imagine Lord [Seymor] will rise to<NL>
great glory in [Spira].<END>

<NL>
For countless years, we [Guado] shunned<NL>
the teachings of [Yevon2].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But thanks to the late Lord [Jyscal],<NL>
our bonds with the temple grew strong.<END>

<NL>
I heard that Lord [Seymor] studied<NL>
the teachings in [Macalania].<END>

<NL>
I believe that Lord [Seymor]<NL>
will return for us.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But whether he will save us<NL>
or destroy us, I know not.<END>
