[Tidus]<NL>
What the...?<END>

<NL>
The [Farplane] was cool, but I<NL>
couldn't stop thinking about [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
Her parents--they looked so happy together.<END>

<NL>
But it got me worried that maybe<NL>
seeing them would make Yuna really<NL>
consider [Seymor]'s proposal.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yo, [Chappu]!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Meant to come see you earlier, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Sorry!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I know you won't hold it against me.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I gave up the game.<NL>
I'm a guardian from<NL>
here on, you know?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
This guy--looks a lot<NL>
like you--showed up.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Travelling with him,<NL>
I thought, maybe...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
you were still alive somewhere, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But, then again, here<NL>
you are on the [Farplane].<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Guess your place is here.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
So, how you been?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Oh, that guy I just told you 'bout.<NL>
I gave him your sword.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He likes it.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Just a sec more.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Why don't you try calling someone?<NL>
All you have to do is think about them.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
He is dead, and I am still alive.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Coming here really makes that clear.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I should focus more on<NL>
what I have to do now.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I'm not even sure what I'm saying.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Don't you mean that you<NL>
should leave [Chappu] behind?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm sure he was a great guy,<NL>
but there'll be others.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Hmm...<NL>
That's a possibility.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How about...<NL>
[Wakka]?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
What, me? With [Wakka]?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, you two get along great!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Getting along isn't enough.<NL>
Not even close.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, sorry. My mistake.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You'd do well to remember that.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Knowing a bit about women<NL>
might come in handy some day.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, I'll remember.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I won't be forgetting either.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Goodbye, [Chappu].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You always said I looked grumpy.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
But those were the<NL>
happiest days of my life.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So...[Yuna]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I've decided.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh? Really?<NL>
That's good.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I remember, when I was only<NL>
seven years old, in [Bevelle] that day.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
My father had defeated [Sin], and<NL>
the whole town was out in the streets.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Everyone was laughing.<NL>
They all seemed so happy.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
If I defeated [Sin], that would<NL>
make everyone happy...wouldn't it?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I must do what everyone<NL>
wants, not just what I want.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's go back!<NL>
You gotta tell [Seymor].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Before that...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Call Sir [Jecht].<NL>
Give it a try.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Don't worry. He won't come.<END>

<NL>
Trying not to think about my old man<NL>
made me think about him, of course.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
See, told you!<END>

<NL>
He isn't here because<NL>
he's not dead. He's [Sin].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
That means he's alive, you know?<END>

<NL>
What if my old man really is [Sin]?<END>

<NL>
What would I say to [Yuna]...<NL>
heck, to everybody in [Spira]?<END>

<NL>
Wait, why should I have<NL>
to apologize for him, anyway?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'd rather never see him again.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What makes you hate him so?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Everything he does<NL>
just makes me mad.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It was his fault that<NL>
me and my mother...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Mom?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's her!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
She's very pretty.<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
<TEXT>
But...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Wait. No one ever performed<NL>
the sending for her.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
She must've accepted death<NL>
while she was still alive.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whoa there, that's my<NL>
mother you're talking about.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Oh, I'm sorry!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's okay.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I think I just figured something out.<END>

<TEXT>
[Yuna]<NL>
What?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why I hate my old man.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, man...<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I must sound so stupid.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I don't think so.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How embarrassing!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Well? Need some more time?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
No, I'm ready.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Did I miss something?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No one there?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
She's not appearing.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Who is it?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
None of your business.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sorry.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
No...it's not your fault.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Why aren't you here?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I need to be alone right now.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I'm still not the person<NL>
I wanted to become, not yet.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I'll come back to let<NL>
you know how things went.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I hope I'll bring<NL>
back...good news.<END>

<NL>
Been a while, sis.<END>

<NL>
It's been seven years, but<NL>
you still look the same.<NL>
Geez, I'm older than you, now!<END>

<NL>
I guess it makes sense.<END>

<NL>
Hey, I...I brought you something!<NL>
Check this out!<END>

<NL>
See? She looks just like you!<NL>
Her name's "[Yuna]."<END>

<NL>
Boy was I surprised<NL>
first time I saw her!<END>

<NL>
I almost thought you had come back!<END>

<NL>
[Yuna]'s a summoner, too--<NL>
a pretty good one.<END>

<NL>
Ah, 'course she's not as good as you.<END>

<NL>
If you were still alive,<NL>
I bet you'd fight just like her.<END>

<NL>
It's okay. [Yuna] will beat<NL>
[Sin] for you, I know it.<END>

<NL>
So, don't you worry.<NL>
Okay, sis?<END>

<NL>
See you.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
I have prayed and prayed, yet<NL>
Lord [Seymor] does not appear.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Has he not reached the [Farplane]?<NL>
Has he become a fiend?<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Oh, my poor Lord [Seymor]...<NL>
Tell me, where do you wander?<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
When Lord [Jyscal] was alive, the<NL>
[Guado] knew prosperity and honor.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
But now, we [Guado]<NL>
wither and crumble.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
I, myself, could have<NL>
done more to stop this.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Forgive me, Lord [Jyscal]!<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Lord [Jyscal]!<NL>
I beg your forgiveness!<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Benevolent Lord [Jyscal],<NL>
and most wise Lord [Seymor].<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
The days spent in your<NL>
service were the best<NL>
in this old man's life.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Those of us left behind will<NL>
soon be destroyed by [Sin]<NL>
and join you in the [Farplane].<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
I will serve you there<NL>
as I have served you<NL>
in this world, always.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Even should [Sin] disappear,<NL>
the [Guado] are doomed<NL>
without a leader.<END>
