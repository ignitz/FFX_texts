[Wakka]<NL>
Where'd you meet<NL>
Sir [Auron], anyway?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>I'm not telling.<NL>
<CHOICE2>[Zanarkand].<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Ah, never mind.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Sin]'s toxin sure is<NL>
taking its time wearing off.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Anyway, I knew you'd find<NL>
someone you knew here.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We'll be taking the <Cor 88><NL>
[Mi'ihen] Highroad<Cor 41> north,<NL>
toward <Cor 88>[Djose] Temple<Cor 41>.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You're a real guardian now,<NL>
so no mistakes. Understood?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Remember, you're suffering from<NL>
[Sin]'s toxin.<NL>
Don't say otherwise.<END>

<NL>
There are so many people<NL>
fleeing [Bevelle]. They say<NL>
it's utter chaos over there.<END>

<NL>
Their owner's a [Crusader]<NL>
and he hasn't returned yet...<END>

<NL>
They haven't eaten at all.<NL>
They're waiting for their<NL>
master to come home and feed them.<END>

<NL>
Their owner's a [Crusader].<NL>
I'm only looking after 'em<NL>
while the operation's going on.<END>

<NL>
I'd hate to see these fellas left<NL>
on their own. I hope their owner<NL>
returns safely.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s are guarding the stadium.<NL>
If any fiends appear, we'll destroy<NL>
them even if it means our lives.<END>

<NL>
I heard Lady [Yuna] is to marry. We will<NL>
keep watch at the wedding to ensure<NL>
nothing disrupts that happy day.<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks will defend<NL>
[Luca] and keep the stadium<NL>
secure. You can count on it.<END>

<NL>
Nothing you say will sway us.<NL>
The [Crusader]s will proceed with<NL>
the operation as planned.<END>

<NL>
I am well aware of the risks of this<NL>
mission. But we cannot simply run away.<END>

<NL>
The Crusaders are kicking up a real<NL>
ruckus down the Highroad. This operation<NL>
of theirs is getting out of hand.<END>

<NL>
Well, if they really can wipe out [Sin],<NL>
I guess it's worth a little confusion.<END>

<NL>
The youth of [Luca] are flocking<NL>
to the [Crusader]s in droves!<NL>
Lord Mi'ihen would be proud.<END>

<NL>
I hope the surviving [Crusader]s<NL>
rest well and recover quickly.<END>

<NL>
I tried to stop the [Crusader]s,<NL>
but I tell you, those youngsters<NL>
won't listen to anybody!<END>

<NL>
I fear [Sin] will crush them<NL>
and teach them just how futile<NL>
repentance is then.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Hmm?<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Whatcha doing here?<NL>
The tournament's about to start!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm looking for someone.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Well, you're looking in the wrong place.<NL>
There aren't many people here.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Everyone's either at the stadium<NL>
or watching the game on the sphere.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
They love their [blitzball].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Aren't you gonna watch?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
We'd like to, but we're<NL>
waiting for some couriers.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Hmm, they're late...<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Wanna ditch the courier<NL>
and go watch the game?<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
But...but we're still on duty.<NL>
What about the mission, sir?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
See what I mean?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
We might be a little late, <NL>
but we will go watch you play.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
You'd better be winning<NL>
when we get there.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yes, sir!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Are you sure?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Never liked long goodbyes anyway.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Sorry for making you wait, [Yuna].<NL>
I had some promises to keep, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
From now on,<NL>
I'm your full-time guardian.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Then welcome back, Sir [Wakka].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Good to have you with us.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hey, it's good to be back, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
So, any news on what happened?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Maester [Seymor]'s aeon...<NL>
It was so powerful.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Do you think he's<NL>
gonna stay here?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Sir [Auron] knows him, apparently.<NL>
You were right.<NL>
He did meet someone he knew. <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Do you think he'll find<NL>
a way back to [Zanarkand]?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
In any case,<NL>
I'll miss having him around.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
He's still in town, isn't he?<NL>
I think I'll go see him...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Oh!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Whoa.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sir [Auron]?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Yuna].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sir?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I wish to become your guardian.<NL>
Do you accept?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You're serious?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
You refuse?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
No, no!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
We accept!<NL>
Right, everyone?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
O-Of course!<NL>
No problem at all!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
But...why?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I promised [Braska].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You promised my father?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thank you, Sir [Auron]!<NL>
You're welcome to join us!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
And...he comes too.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hi...guys.<NL>
Eh...howdy!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
This one I promised [Jecht].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Is Sir [Jecht] alive?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Can't say. Haven't<NL>
seen him in ten years.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I...see.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
You'll meet eventually.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes, I'm looking forward to it!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
What's our itinerary?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Where are we headed?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Hey! Come with me!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Hey, watch!<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, you got pretty good.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You sound sad.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, maybe.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Wanna scream?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I really don't think<NL>
that's gonna help this time.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You know what?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's embarrassing to say this myself...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But summoners and their guardians<NL>
are kind of like [Spira]'s ray of light.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
A lot of people in<NL>
Spira depend on us.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I learned to practice smiling<NL>
when I'm feeling sad, you know?<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I know it's hard.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah...<NL>
I understand. I think.<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Come on!<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You probably shouldn't<NL>
laugh any more.<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I want my journey to<NL>
be full of laughter.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Okay.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
If we should get separated, just whistle.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'll come running.<NL>
I promise.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, let's go.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Okay.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What're you looking at?<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Right, now let's see what you can do!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
This is weird!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Next, try laughing out loud!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Come on, show me!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Too funny!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It was your idea!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Um...thank you.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We were just worried<NL>
you guys might've gone crazy!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sorry!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Well then, alright.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Now, we will go to<NL>
the temple at <Cor 88>Djose<Cor 41>.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And guardians?<NL>
Don't forget to smile!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Not really.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
We don't know where<NL>
the fiends came from.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Maester Mika] is safe and sound,<NL>
thanks to Maester [Seymor].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
That's about it.<END>
