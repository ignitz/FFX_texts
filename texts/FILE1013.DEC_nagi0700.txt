<NL>
You've beaten my mightiest beast?<NL>
Mmm, what extraordinary power!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
All right! From now on, you shall be<NL>
known as the "One Who Conquered All!"<END>

<NL>
I never imagined that my mightiest<NL>
creation could be defeated.<END>

<NL>
Yes. Truly remarkable!<NL>
I can't find any other way to express it!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
All that's left to do is to defeat [Sin]!<NL>
I have faith in you, sonny.<END>

<NL>
There won't be any more new fiends,<NL>
but you can still battle them anytime.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Feel free to come back whenever<NL>
you wish to train!<END>

<NL>
You'll of course need to pay for it, though!<NL>
Hahaha...<END>

<NL>
This is a training arena that Lord [Mi'ihen]<NL>
constructed for the [Crusader]s.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
You can hone your battle skills here by fighting<NL>
fiends gathered from all over [Spira]!<END>

<NL>
But...the fiends all got away<NL>
because I, uh, screwed up.<END>

<NL>
I'm too old to gather fiends now,<NL>
so I'm in quite a fix...<END>

<NL>
So, that's where you come in, sonny!<NL>
Can I ask you to round up all the<NL>
fiends for me?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Of course, I'm not asking you to do it<NL>
for free. There'll be nice, fat rewards!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
On top of that, you can hone your<NL>
fighting skills anytime against the<NL>
fiends you bring back here!<END>

<NL>
In addition, any items you win during<NL>
training are yours to keep for free!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But, there will be a small fee for each<NL>
training session, so bear that in mind.<END>

<NL>
How about it? Not a bad deal, eh?<NL>
You won't regret it!<END>

<NL>
Hmm... And I was thinking to reward you<NL>
with a variety of rare items I've collected.<NL>
Are you sure?<END>

<NL>
That's the spirit, sonny!<NL>
Now, go catch all them fiends!<END>

<NL>
But I've one more warning before<NL>
I can let you go.<END>

<NL>
To catch a fiend, you have to<NL>
<Cor 43>defeat it with a special kind of weapon<Cor 41>!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But not to worry! I'll sell them<NL>
to you for a special low price!<END>

<NL>
Also, this arena can only hold<NL>
ten of each kind of fiend.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
There won't be any bonuses for capturing<NL>
more, so keep an eye on your totals!<END>

<NL>
This is an arena where you can train<NL>
by battling fiends, but it's closed<NL>
because all of the fiends escaped.<END>

<NL>
So, I need someone to catch specimens<NL>
of every fiend in [Spira] for me.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If you can bring them back here, I'll<NL>
reward you with fantastic items!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
On top of that, you can fight any<NL>
fiend anytime, and keep any treasure<NL>
you win from them.<END>

<NL>
Well, the only catch is a small fee<NL>
for each training session.<END>

<NL>
How about it? Do we have a deal?<END>

<NL>
How about it? Will you catch<NL>
some fiends for me?<END>

<NL>
I need you to start by collecting each<NL>
species in the [Calm Lands].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I can't reopen the arena without<NL>
having some fiends, you know.<END>

<NL>
By the way, there's a total of <Cor 43>nine<NL>
species<Cor 41> in the [Calm Lands]. I'll give<NL>
you a bonus when you get all of them.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Oh! Before I forget, you have to use a<NL>
special kind of weapon to catch them!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'll sell some to you at a special price!<NL>
No, no! No need to thank me!<END>

<NL>
So far, you've collected <VAR12 30> from the<NL>
[Calm Lands]. You've got <VAR12 31> more to go.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
You'll find weaker fiends nearby, but go<NL>
search the northwest for the big game!<END>

<NL>
Ah! You've caught all the fiends of the<NL>
[Calm Lands]. Now I can reopen the arena!<END>

<NL>
Oops, I almost forgot. Here's a token<NL>
of my appreciation for your hard work.<END>

I don't know if you have what<NL>
it takes to open it, though.<END>

Head out to [Besaid] and capture the<NL>

kinds, you'll be done in a jiffy. <END>

<NL>
Close! Just one more species and we'll<NL>
have every kind of fiend on [Besaid Island]!<NL>
Keep it up, kiddo!<END>

So you've been hunting on<NL>
[Besaid Island], eh? You sure<NL>
got there and back in a hurry.<END>

Aha! Just one more species from<NL>
the [Mi'ihen Highroad] and we'll have<NL>
a complete collection! Hustle, sonny!<END>

Bring me some fiends from the [Djose] Road.<NL>
It ain't a big place, so you'll<NL>
be done before you know it!<END>

<NL>
Ngah! We're one species short of<NL>
having a whole set of [Djose] Road fiends!<NL>
Find one and nab it!<END>

Ah, so you've been hunting on the<NL>
[Djose] Road. I see you've<NL>
got quite a menagerie.<END>

<NL>
Been hunting out on the [Thunder Plains], eh?<NL>
Tread lightly, my boy! Tread lightly!<END>

<NL>
There's this cave under a gorge<NL>

Bring me the fiends there!<END>

<NL>
Why, just one more species<NL>
from the cave at the bottom of<NL>
the gorge! Get back down there!<END>

<NL>
So you've been spelunking, eh?<NL>
Well, keep it up. There's more<NL>
fiends to catch in them caverns!<END>

<NL>
Go hunt for fiends on [Bikanel Island].<NL>
There's gotta be tons of 'em<NL>
under all that sand!<END>

Lo and behold! One species more and<NL>
we'll have every kind from [Bikanel Island]!<NL>
Get back out there, son!<END>

on [Kilika Island]? Well, you still<NL>
got a ways to go, I reckon!<END>

fiends living inside [Sin]. Maybe<NL>
you can go catch some for me!<END>

<NL>
Bingo! Just one more species and<NL>
we'll have a complete set from<NL>
inside [Sin]! Good luck, sonny!<END>

<NL>
Looks like you've caught some<NL>
fiends from inside [Sin]'s guts.<NL>
Remember, you're my only hope!<END>

Grim fiends lurk in the dungeon<NL>

<NL>
You know about the hard-shelled<NL>
guys, right? I sure want to know<NL>
which is the toughest.<END>

<NL>
I need a few more of those<NL>
hard-shelled guys. I'm sure<NL>
you know where to find more!<END>

shelled buggers. Keep on<NL>
smashing their shells for me!<END>

<NL>
I sure want to find out<NL>
where winged imps get their<NL>
powers of lightning from.<END>

<NL>
I need just a few more winged<NL>
imps to round out my collection!<END>

<NL>
So you've caught some winged<NL>
imps, huh? They rely on magic,<NL>
so use it against them!<END>

<NL>
There are many kinds of wolven<NL>
fiends all over [Spira].<NL>
How about nabbing some for me?<END>

<NL>
Mind catching me a few more wolves?<NL>
I need more to continue me research!<END>

would happen if you mixed flan<NL>
of different elements together.<END>

<NL>
I need just a few more flan!<NL>
Can't wait to mix them all toghether!<END>

<NL>
Been flan-hunting, huh?<NL>
Use your weapons, not magic,<NL>
if you want to capture them!<END>

<NL>
Different parts of [Spira] are<NL>
home to different kinds of lizards.<NL>
Could you go capture some for me?<END>

dragon in my collection!<END>

<NL>
So you've been catching dragons, eh?<NL>
Hope you got weapons that<NL>
can pierce their scales!<END>

<NL>
I wonder what makes elementals tick...<NL>
Sure wish I had some to study.<END>

So you started an elemental collection, eh?<NL>
Hit 'em with the element they hate most!<END>

<NL>
I wonder what fuel those<NL>
iron giants run on? Sure wish<NL>
I had some to tinker with...<END>

<NL>
I need just a few more iron giants.<NL>
They're tough, so be careful.<END>

<NL>
So you've been capturing<NL>
iron giants, eh? Be sure<NL>

<NL>
I want to research fiends that<NL>
blow up when you smack them.<END>

Good. You've been gathering<NL>
bombs. Be sure to catch them<NL>
before they go boom!<END>

<NL>
I want you to nab some<NL>
unsavory mushrooms. They might<NL>
look tasty, but they ain't!<END>

<NL>
I need just a couple more mushrooms.<NL>
Take care when harvesting!<END>

<NL>
So you've been gathering mushrooms, eh?<NL>
Hit 'em with magic or they'll get upset!<END>

Thanks to you, the monster<NL>
collection is growing.<END>
