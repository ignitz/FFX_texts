[Yunalesca]<NL>
Have you chosen the one<NL>
to become your [fayth]?<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Who will it be?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Might I ask something first?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Will [Sin] come back even should I<NL>
use the Final Summoning to defeat it?<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
[Sin] is eternal.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Every aeon that defeats it<NL>
becomes [Sin] in its place...<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
And thus is [Sin] reborn.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So that's why [Jecht]<NL>
became [Sin].<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
[Sin] is an inevitable part of<NL>
[Spira]'s destiny. It is neverending.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Neverending?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But...but...if we atone for our crimes,<NL>
[Sin] will stop coming back, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Someday, it'll be gone, ya?<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Will humanity ever<NL>
attain such purity?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
This...this cannot be!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The teachings state that we can<NL>
exorcise [Sin] with complete atonement!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
It's been our only<NL>
hope all these years!<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Hope is...comforting.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
It allows us to accept fate,<NL>
however tragic it might be.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
No!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Where is the sense in all this?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Braska] believed in [Yevon2]'s<NL>
teachings and died for them!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Jecht] believed in [Braska]<NL>
and gave his life for him!<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
They chose to die...<NL>
because they had hope.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
[Yevon2]'s teachings and<NL>
the Final Summoning give<NL>
the people of [Spira] hope.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Without hope, they would<NL>
drown in their sorrow.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Now, choose.<NL>
Who will be your [fayth]?<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Who will be the one to<NL>
renew [Spira]'s hope?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
No one.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
No. It is our only hope.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Your father sacrificed himself<NL>
to give that hope to the people.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
So they would forget sorrow.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Sorrow cannot be abolished.<NL>
It is meaningless to try.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Poor creature.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
You would throw away hope.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Well...<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
I will free you before you<NL>
can drown in your sorrow.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
It is better for you to die in<NL>
hope than to live in despair.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Let me be your liberator.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Yuna] needs [Kimahri].<NL>
[Kimahri] protect [Yuna].<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Well, I'm fighting!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I can't believe we're gonna<NL>
fight Lady [Yunalesca]! Gimme a break!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You can always run.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
My thoughts exactly.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
If I die, so does the Final Aeon.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
And with it, [Spira]'s only hope.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Then we'll find [Spira] a new hope!<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Fool. There is no other way.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Even if there was...<NL>
Even if you did destroy [Sin]...<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Yu Yevon the immortal<NL>
would only create [Sin] anew.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yu Yevon!?<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Ah... [Zaon]...<NL>
Forgive me...<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
[Spira] has been robbed of the light<NL>
of hope... All that remains is sorrow.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I cannot believe what we just did.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's do something more unbelievable.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
What?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I don't know how just yet.<NL>
But I'll find out.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I would have gladly died.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I live for the people of [Spira],<NL>
and would have gladly died for them.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But no more!<NL>
The Final Summoning...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
is a false tradition that<NL>
should be thrown away.<END>

<TEXT>
[Yuna]<NL>
Wrong.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
My father... My father wanted...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
to make [Spira]'s sorrow go away.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Not just cover it up with lies!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
My father... I loved him.<END>

<TEXT>
[Yuna]<NL>
So I...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I will live with my sorrow,<NL>
I will live my own life!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I will defeat sorrow, in his place.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I will stand my ground and be strong.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I don't know when it will be<NL>
but someday, I will conquer it.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And I will do it without...false hope.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Now! This is it!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Now is the time to choose!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Die and be free of pain<NL>
or live and fight your sorrow!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Now is the time to shape your stories! <NL>
Your fate is in your hands!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hah!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I'd never forgive myself--no way!<NL>
Not if I ran away now.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Even in death, ya!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
This is our story! Now let's see<NL>
this thing through together.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Destroy [Sin].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So it won't come back,<NL>
and without the Final Aeon.<END>
