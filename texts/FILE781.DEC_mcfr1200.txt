[Yuna]<NL>
I always thought that this<NL>
would be easier somehow.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I thought that everyone would help me...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
with all my friends together beside me.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I've been trying so hard.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Maybe you're trying too hard.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
They told me...everything.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Everything?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Well, so then...<NL>
you know.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's just, you know...<NL>
all those things I said.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Like "Let's go get [Sin]!"<NL>
Or about [Zanarkand]...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I didn't know what would<NL>
happen to you, [Yuna].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I guess...<NL>
I hope it didn't make you sad.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Forgive me.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I wasn't sad.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I was happy.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Just don't do it.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The pilgrimage?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
That's right.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Forget all about [Sin], about<NL>
being a summoner. Forget all that.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You know, live a normal life.<NL>
Come on now, [Yuna], what do you say?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Maybe I will.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Wouldn't everyone be surprised?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Except [Rikku].<NL>
She'd be with you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Lulu] and [Wakka]<NL>
wouldn't hold out long.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Kimahri] would say yes, too, I know.<NL>
But Sir [Auron]...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'll make him understand, [Yuna].<NL>
It's the least I can do for you.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
No, I should tell him.<NL>
He deserves it.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What'll I do if I give up my pilgrimage?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey! [Zanarkand]!<NL>
Let's go to [Zanarkand]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Not the one in [Spira],<NL>
the one I'm from.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, we can all fly there.<NL>
Everyone can go!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Then we'll have a big<NL>
party at my place!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And then we could see [blitzball]!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Your [Zanarkand Abes] would play!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
We could all watch you play,<NL>
in the stadium all lit up at night.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'd cheer and cheer till<NL>
I couldn't cheer anymore!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Right on!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Well, what about after the game?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We'd go out and have fun!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
In the middle of the night?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No problem!<NL>
[Zanarkand] never sleeps!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's go to the sea,<NL>
before the sunrise.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The city lights go out one by one.<NL>
The stars fade...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Then the horizon glows,<NL>
almost like it's on fire.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's kinda rose-colored, right? First<NL>
in the sea, then it spreads to the sky,<NL>
then to the whole city. It gets brighter<NL>
and brighter, till everything glows.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's really...pretty.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I know you'd like it.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'd like to see it, someday.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well you can, [Yuna].<NL>
We can both go!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yu...?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I can't.<NL>
I just can't!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I can't go!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'll continue. I must.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
If I give up now...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I could do anything<NL>
I wanted to, and yet...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Even if I was with you,<NL>
I could never forget.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'll go with you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm your guardian.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Unless I'm...fired?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Stay with me until the end. Please.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Not until the end...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Always.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Always, then.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Maybe you should<NL>
head back to camp first.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Roger!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Wait, I'll go with you.<END>
