[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] never forget<NL>
the [Al Bhed] sacrifice.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] will use machina,<NL>
if machina can find [Yuna].<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Yuna] should make<NL>
[Yuna]'s decision.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Yuna] in trouble.<NL>
[Kimahri] worried.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
You keep walking path forward.<NL>
[Kimahri] watch the rear.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Because of you,<NL>
[Yuna] still smiles.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Thank you.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Friends have saved [Kimahri]'s life.<NL>
[Kimahri] will treasure it.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] is ready.<NL>
Let us fight [Sin].<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Sin] still lives.<NL>
[Kimahri] knows.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
The [Ronso] were singing, too.<NL>
[Kimahri]'s ears never wrong.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] felt friendship<NL>
from somewhere inside [Sin].<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
There is no need for fear.<NL>
[Kimahri] will go with you.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
We owe our lives to the [Al Bhed].<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
However, no matter how they beg,<NL>
we cannot quit our pilgrimage.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Even though you'll die?<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
I've known since I was a child.<NL>
My will is set.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
If I do not do it, someone<NL>
else must, you understand.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
I'm amazed this thing can fly, truly!<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
It must be sacrilege to<NL>
think so highly of a machina.<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
I feel uneasy just riding it!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sure it's not motion sickness?<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
Motion sickness?<NL>
What infirmity is that?<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
As soon as we land,<NL>
we continue the pilgrimage!<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Hey, I'm not looking forward<NL>
to my brother dying when this is all over.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
If only there was some way of<NL>
doing it without anyone dying.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's think of one!<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Easier said than done.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
If we had all the time in the world,<NL>
yeah, we'd think of something.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
And while we were thinking,<NL>
[Sin] would kill us all.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
[Spira] doesn't have that time.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
The [Al Bhed] caught up<NL>
to us in [Besaid].<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
They grabbed [Pacce],<NL>
so we had to do what they said.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
We needed a break, anyway.<NL>
[Pacce] was pretty tired.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
He should never have come<NL>
on the pilgrimage, little kid like that.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Still, he does pretty good for his size.<NL>
He's gonna be something someday.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Hey, you know<NL>
where this ship's headed?<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Be careful!<END>

[Isaaru]<NL>
Let him rest.<END>

[Maroda]<NL>
Let him sleep, man.<END>

[Pacce]<NL>
Don't worry!<NL>
We'll guard this area!<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Well, well.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
It appears you, too,<NL>
have escaped harm.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You were on the ship, too?<END>

[Rin]<NL>
I came to [Home] to pick up some<NL>
goods and found myself here.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Quite the escape.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Thankfully, my goods were spared.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Please let me know if you<NL>
need any of my wares.<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Got any weapons?<NL>
<CHOICE2>Got any items?<NL>
<CHOICE3>Leave.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Thank you. Your patronage<NL>
is very much appreciated.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
All proceeds will go<NL>
to help restore [Home].<END>

[Rin]<NL>
May I help you?<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Welcome!<END>

[Rin]<NL>
[Rin]'s Aerial Branch Office,<NL>
at your service.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Welcome!<END>

[Rin]<NL>
How may I assist you today?<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Lady [Yuna] has become<NL>
quite the summoner.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
A gentle nature,<NL>
yet strong as steel.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
She reminds me of her parents.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna]'s old man was a priest of [Yevon2],<NL>
but he married an [Al Bhed], huh?<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Lord [Braska] wanted peace<NL>
between his people and ours.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
He would occasionally visit<NL>
the [Home] of those days.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So that's how he<NL>
met [Cid]'s sister?<END>

[Rin]<NL>
They ran off together,<NL>
into the night.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hmph. Sounds like love.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Wow, [Cid] must've been furious!<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Yes.<NL>
He wouldn't talk to her after that.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
But, when [Yuna] was born,<NL>
they made up again.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
His sister took off<NL>
for [Home] at once.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
But then, her ship...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Sin]?<END>

[Rin]<NL>
That incident turned Lord [Braska]<NL>
down the summoner's path.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Everything leads back to [Sin].<END>

[Rin]<NL>
But, you'll put an end to it?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
With a vengeance.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
I pray for your success.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Any last minute supplies<NL>
before the showdown?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You're selling stuff? Now?<END>

[Rin]<NL>
But of course.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Once [Sin] is gone, we'll need<NL>
to be rebuilding [Home], you see.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Man, your dedication is...<NL>
really astounding.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Ah, how is your<NL>
progress with our language?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
None too shabby!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Check this out!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Nice to meet you.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Just repeating what<NL>
I've said is not talking, now.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
But your pronunciation's quite passable.<NL>
You've been studying, I see.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
If there's anything I can help<NL>
you with in the future, just ask.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I am in your debt!<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Very good!<END>

[Rin]<NL>
You have well<NL>
learned our tongue.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Easy, once you know the trick!<END>

[Rin]<NL>
To think the day would come,<NL>
that we could talk so,<NL>
it is joyous indeed!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I am happy too!<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Here, a present to<NL>
congratulate your success!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Thank you!<END>

<NL>
Those [Guado]! They will feel<NL>
my wrath in the [blitz] sphere!<END>

<NL>
This I leave to you!<NL>
Battle was never my forte.<END>

<NL>
I long for the sands of [Bikanel].<NL>
Desert it may be, but there<NL>
is no place like home!<END>

<NL>
The lord [Mika], an unsent?<NL>
But I saw him in [Luca].<END>

<NL>
If every mouth in [Spira] sings,<NL>
we may win this battle.<END>

<NL>
Should we not be watching<NL>
[Sin] more closely?<END>

<NL>
You will attack [Sin] head on?<NL>
Truly a great warrior are you!<END>

<NL>
Never have I thought of flying<NL>
into [Sin]! Not even in dreams!<END>

<NL>
Now is the time<NL>
to train, train!<END>

<NL>
Everyone be calm! Be calm!<NL>
Fear is our enemy!<END>

<NL>
That was first time being<NL>
so close to [Sin]!<END>

<NL>
Being on ship is bad for health.<NL>
Let us kick the [blitzball]!<END>

<NL>
Soon is the final battle with [Sin]!<NL>
How very excited I am!<END>

<NL>
This is the calm before the storm.<NL>
Now is time to train, train!<END>

<NL>
Make this battle the last!<NL>
We are counting on you!<END>

<NL>
When the [Calm] comes, we will play<NL>
each day! Now we must train, train!<END>

<NL>
Forgive me for my actions in [Luca].<NL>
We wanted to protect the [summoner], you see?<END>

<NL>
[Yevon2] found the place of our [Home].<NL>
Perhaps we were followed?<END>

<NL>
In ancient times a temple was in [Baaj].<NL>
Now it is a nest for [fiend] only.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
There is great treasure<NL>
in the deserted temple, they say.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But a great [fiend] lives there too,<NL>
and guards the treasure.<END>

<NL>
My friend, he went to [Baaj] to<NL>
explore. He told a story...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
In the deserted temple there, faintly<NL>
the Hymn of the Fayth can be heard!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Maybe it has something to do<NL>
with the [aeons] I think.<END>

<NL>
[Baaj] is a place of mystery.<NL>
Mystery worth exploring, no?<END>

<NL>
I have faith you will do this thing.<NL>
I will sing, too, for I believe.<END>

<NL>
When the battle is over,<NL>
we will play [blitz] once more!<END>

<NL>
Since childhood, I have played<NL>
only [blitz]! It is true!<END>

<NL>
I hoped only to rest at [Home] a while<NL>
then return to [Luca].<END>

<NL>
You are a traitor, no?<NL>
Then you are one with the [Al Bhed]!<END>

<NL>
Both [Yunalesca] and [Mika] were dead,<NL>
yet they clung to [Spira] tightly.<END>

<NL>
Pardon me. So scared was I that<NL>
I began to tremble all over!<END>

<NL>
Such fear I knew before the battle!<NL>
But the singing did calm me.<END>

<NL>
I wish the battles<NL>
would be over...<END>

<NL>
Going inside [Sin]...<NL>
I sang in fright and would not stop!<END>

<NL>
The [Al Bhed Psyches] all escaped harm.<NL>
We are ready to play again!<END>

<NL>
Have care! There are [fiend]<NL>
in all places!<END>

<NL>
I wonder, where will the<NL>
[airship] go from here?<END>

<NL>
I want to be a top player.<NL>
Many teams I want to try.<END>

<NL>
I do not run around in panic!<NL>
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst!<END>

<NL>
Leave the ship to us [Al Bhed].<NL>
Take rest while you are able.<END>

<NL>
I know it will not do to panic,<NL>
but I do not know how to be calm!<END>

<NL>
[Rikku] and [Yuna] are<NL>
in your hands.<END>

<NL>
We need [blitz] to cheer our people<NL>
after the loss of [Home], you see?<END>

<NL>
I will not die in this place!<NL>
I fear no [fiend]! Come, and I will fight!<END>

<NL>
I must train or the [airship]<NL>
will rob me of my muscles!<END>

<NL>
The age of the temples is past.<NL>
Now comes the age of [machina]!<END>

<NL>
Elder [Cid] has great courage!<NL>
I must learn to be like him.<END>

<NL>
The ship rocked so much<NL>
I felt quite funny!<END>

<NL>
When the time comes, I will fight.<NL>
[Sin]! Here is my best shot!<END>

<NL>
How was it inside [Sin]?<NL>
Many [fiend] there, I think.<END>
