Inside, maybe?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Then what are we<NL>
standing here for?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
H-Hey!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You can stuff your taboos!<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
There's the last of them.<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
You are to stand trial.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I expect it will be a fair trial.<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
Of course it will.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I'm afraid the grand maester<NL>
is nowhere to be found!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
S'okay, we were just leaving.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Oh...I see.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Hey!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Maybe you could<NL>
help us with the hymn.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, good idea!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
It's like, we need you to tell<NL>
as many people as you can.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
What should I tell them?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
A ship in the sky will<NL>
sing the Hymn of the Fayth.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
When they hear it,<NL>
we need everyone to sing along!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Everyone in Spira!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I'm not sure I understand.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You don't have to!<NL>
Just tell everyone!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
A ship in the sky will<NL>
sing the Hymn of the Fayth?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
So when they hear it,<NL>
everyone should sing along, correct?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
If they do, we might<NL>
be able to defeat [Sin]!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Truly?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
That's wonderful!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
You can count on me!<NL>
I shall tell all of Spira!<END>
