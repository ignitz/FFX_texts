Hic! Eh...I've been protecting<NL>
Maester [Seymor] since he was a wee lad.<END>

<NL>
Ask me anything ye want to know 'bout<NL>
Maester [Seymor].<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>[Seymor] as a young child.<NL>
<CHOICE2>[Seymor] as a young man.<NL>
<CHOICE3>[Seymor] as a monk.<NL>
<CHOICE4>[Seymor] as a summoner.<NL>
<CHOICE5>Don't care to know.<END>

<NL>
Both [Guado] and human blood flow<NL>
through Maester [Seymor]'s veins.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
This mixed heritage caused him a<NL>
deal of grief in his childhood.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But because of that very experience...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
he grew to become a great leader<NL>
who aspired to bring [Guado] and<NL>
humans together in friendship.<END>

<NL>
Ye do wanna know more<NL>
about Maester [Seymor], no?<END>

<NL>
Lord [Braska] vanquished [Sin]<NL>
when Lord [Seymor] was about your age.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
During the celebration of the Calm's<NL>
arrival, [Maester Mika2] ordained<NL>
Lord [Jyscal] a maester of [Yevon2].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He praised Lord [Jyscal]'s achievements,<NL>
including the conversion of the [Guado2]<NL>
to the teachings of Yevon.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Maester [Seymor] was still a young lad<NL>
then, but he tried hard to assist Lord [Jyscal].<END>

<NL>
As a monk, Maester [Seymor] soon<NL>
distinguished himself.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
His accomplishments were many and<NL>
acclaimed by all. He shot up through<NL>
the ranks quickly, he did.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Aye, he rose high on his own, never<NL>
riding Lord [Jyscal]'s coattails.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He's truly a remarkable young man.<END>

<NL>
As a summoner, Maester [Seymor]'s<NL>
strength is matchless.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Yet, he became a maester of [Yevon2]<NL>
instead of undertaking the pilgrimage<NL>
to battle [Sin].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I think he believes that there's more to a<NL>
summoner's duty than just destroying [Sin].<END>

<NL>
Don't you hold back, now.<END>

<NL>
With [Seymor] gone and<NL>
Maester [Mika] dead...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
we've lost all our emotional support.<END>

<NL>
This is truly a disgrace.<NL>
Monks are supposed to guide the<NL>
people, not behave like this.<END>

<NL>
I can't believe [Seymor]'s getting married.<NL>
It's certainly something to celebrate!<END>

<NL>
Please give this congratulatory gift<NL>
to Lady Yuna.<END>

<NL>
When [Seymor] was first<NL>
ordained a monk, he was my junior.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Now look at him!<NL>
He's a maester, betrothed to a summoner.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm absolutely nothing<NL>
compared to him.<END>

<NL>
[Seymor] doesn't flaunt his status.<NL>
He's a down-to-earth gentleman.<END>

<NL>
[Seymor]'s actions are inexcusable,<NL>
but I cannot condemn him...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
because I remember how he suffered at<NL>
the hands of both human and [Guado2]<NL>
in his youth.<END>

<NL>
If he hadn't strayed from the path,<NL>
I believe [Seymor] would have<NL>
become a fine maester.<END>

<NL>
Maester [Seymor] always<NL>
smells so nice!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Isn't he grand?<END>

<NL>
The [Guado] used to come here<NL>
often, but now, everyone's gone.<END>

<NL>
I miss my [Guado] friends.<END>

<NL>
I thought I heard a scream!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I know we're celebrating Maester [Seymor]'s<NL>
marriage, but it musn't get out of hand.<END>

<NL>
These are leftovers from the banquet.<NL>
Go ahead, take 'em with you, lad.<END>

<NL>
The [Guado] have apparently lost their<NL>
willpower and are in low spirits. They<NL>
never leave [Guadosalam] anymore.<END>

<NL>
I feel like shutting myself away in a<NL>
temple, too. I just can't believe<NL>
anything anymore.<END>

<NL>
Such a fine day to celebrate!<NL>
The monks should let loose today!<END>

<NL>
Live it up, everyone! Have a<NL>
blast and make everyone happy!<END>

<NL>
With rank set aside like this, I believe<NL>
everyone is behaving a little too wildly.<END>

<NL>
Strip away the exterior, and the<NL>
devout monk is just another man,<NL>
it seems.<END>

<NL>
Did you see my cousin outside?<NL>
We're always competing with each other.<END>

<NL>
But unlike him, I'm a diligent worker.<NL>
I only sleep on the job sometimes...<NL>
Not all the time.<END>
