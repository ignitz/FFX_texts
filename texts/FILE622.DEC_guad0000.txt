<NL>
We have been expecting you, Lady [Yuna].<NL>
Welcome to [Guadosalam].<END>

<NL>
This way, my lady. This way.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Whoa, whoa, whoa!<END>

<NL>
Oh, I beg your pardon.<NL>
I am called [Tromell Guado].<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
I am in the direct service<NL>
of our leader, the great<NL>
[Seymor] [Guado].<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Lord [Seymor] has<NL>
very important business<NL>
with Lady [Yuna].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Business with me?<NL>
Whatever could it be, I wonder?<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Please, come inside<NL>
the manor. All will<NL>
be explained.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Of course, your<NL>
friends are also<NL>
welcome.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Twist our arms, why don't ya?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Ah, I almost forgot!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
What would you do without me?<END>

<TEXT>
<Cor 43>Customizing Equipment<END>

<TEXT>
Now that [Rikku] has joined the party,<NL>
you can <Cor 43>customize<Cor 41> weapons and armor.<NL>
Let's take a look!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna], the high summoner's daughter.<NL>
[Seymor], the leader of the [Guado].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Married in the name of [Yevon2],<NL>
overcoming the barriers of race.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
It would give [Spira] something<NL>
cheery to talk about, for a change.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Sounds just like a passin' daydream,<NL>
like [Auron] says.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Come on, let's just<NL>
get on with the pilgrimage!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I mean, marriage?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Hmmm. Jealous?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What? No way!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We gotta defeat [Sin].<NL>
Romance can wait!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
He sure picked a fine time<NL>
to lay this one on us.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Maybe it is a fine time.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You serious?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
If my getting married<NL>
would help [Spira]...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
if it would make people happy...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
If I could do that for people...<NL>
maybe I should do what I can.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I never imagined doing<NL>
anything like this.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But, I won't answer till<NL>
I know what's right.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Seriously?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You could always just quit<NL>
your pilgrimage and get married.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I will...go on.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm sure that Lord [Seymor]<NL>
will understand.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Umm, I guess so...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I am a summoner!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I must fight and defeat [Sin].<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Like [Braska] before you.<END>

<NL>
I had to stop myself from shouting:<END>

<NL>
What's there to think about?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm going to the <Cor 88>[Farplane]<Cor 41>.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'm going to see my father<NL>
and think on this.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Go on, we'll be<NL>
right behind you.<END>

<NL>
I wondered why none of the others<NL>
ever asked [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
Do you love [Seymor]?<NL>
Do you even like him?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I will go...<NL>
meet with Maester [Seymor].<END>

<TEXT>
[Auron]<NL>
<TEXT>
[Yuna]!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Jyscal] is the [Guado]'s<NL>
problem, not yours.<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
<TEXT>
Umm...<END>

<TEXT>
[Lulu]<NL>
<TEXT>
What?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, [Lulu], what do you think<NL>
about [Yuna] getting married?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
As long as the pilgrimage<NL>
continues, either way's fine.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
That's it?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What if she doesn't even<NL>
like the guy? Is that okay?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
People marry for many reasons.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's that mean?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Sometimes marriage doesn't<NL>
require love, you know?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Defeat [Sin], and bring joy<NL>
to the people of [Spira].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Get married, and bring joy<NL>
to the people of [Spira].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
For [Yuna], they're just<NL>
two ways down the same road.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
All you need is determination.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
If you have that, you don't need love.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I don't know...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I just don't get it.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Wait up, I'll go with ya!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Yunie]'s not getting<NL>
married, is she?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Seems that way.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
It's your big chance, huh?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>I don't care.<NL>
<CHOICE2>I guess you're right.<NL>
<CHOICE3>I'd rather have you, [Rikku].<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
That's no thing to say!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I think she should get married<NL>
and stop being a summoner.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You serious?<END>

<TEXT>
[Rikku]<NL>
<TEXT>
Yeah.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Because it's tough, you know?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
In the end, she has to fight [Sin].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, but she...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
She would never marry<NL>
someone who wanted her to quit.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I guess you're right.<NL>
Too bad.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
That's the way to go!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Then, you could take her away<NL>
and live a quiet life somewhere.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Yeah, sounds good to me!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Maybe someday<Cor 97>!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Listen.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
If [Yuna] gets married, then I...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What? That again?<END>

<TEXT>
[Lulu]<NL>
<TEXT>
Yes.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
If she is to marry, I would<NL>
want her to marry for love.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
See?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
But...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
If [Yuna] said she<NL>
wanted to marry the one she loves,<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I would have to object.<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh... You're not making much sense.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I know.<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
<TEXT>
[Lulu]...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I've talked enough about that.<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
<TEXT>
What?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I'm sorry, just forget about it.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Geez! Grumpy!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You'll understand one of these days.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I just don't want to give it words.<NL>
Not yet.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I shouldn't have to say this,<NL>
but don't fall in love with her. <END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Okay.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Too late.<NL>
<CHOICE3>You're more my type, [Lulu].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
That's fine, then.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I see.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
But...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You must keep your feelings inside,<NL>
until the pilgrimage is over.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Interesting.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I suppose I could add you to my list.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I wish you good luck, little boy.<NL>
You're going to need it.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Say, you ever think<NL>
about gettin' married?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Me? No, never.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I think about it a lot.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Aren't you a little young?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Some people marry really<NL>
young in [Spira], you know.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You mean people our age<NL>
get married?<END>

<TEXT>
[Rikku]<NL>
<TEXT>
Yeah.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Fiends are around,<NL>
and there's always [Sin], right?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
One of them might<NL>
get you, you know?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Lots of people marry the first person<NL>
they fall in love with, just like that!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Really?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I'll probably be the same way.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You an only child?<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
<TEXT>
Yeah.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I got an older brother, myself.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Huh.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I wish I had some younger<NL>
brothers and sisters, though...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So ask your parents.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Mom died...<NL>
A machina went on a rampage...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
When I get married,<NL>
I'm gonna have lots of kids!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
That way they'll all<NL>
have brothers and sisters!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
What?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You're really thinking about your<NL>
future, aren't you? That's great.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
It's pretty normal, I think.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Hey, maybe [Yuna]'s back!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
For a while there, I was a little worried<NL>
about what was gonna happen, ya?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I'm a little worried about Lord [Jyscal].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I wonder if Maester<NL>
[Seymor] has heard.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Leave the [Guado]'s problems<NL>
to the [Guado]...they say.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Guado] potions good.<NL>
Buy some before leaving.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
When we leave here, we have to go<NL>
through the <Cor 88>[Thunder Plains]<Cor 41> next, you know.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I can't stand thunder!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
We leave as soon as [Yuna] returns.<NL>
I trust you'll be ready.<END>

<TEXT>
[Shelinda]<NL>
<TEXT>
My...<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Was the lady summoner<NL>
not with you?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No. She's at [Seymor]'s place.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
That's "Maester [Seymor]."<NL>
Or "Lord [Seymor]."<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, I'll be careful. Sorry.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
That's all right.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Maester [Seymor] left<NL>
[Guadosalam] a short while ago.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You serious?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I believe he went<NL>
to the temple in <Cor 88>Macalania<Cor 41>.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Maester [Seymor]<NL>
is also the high priest of that temple.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whoa, I gotta tell the others!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Please, tell the lady [Yuna] that<NL>
I am doing just as she advised me!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I, too, will go to the temple<NL>
in Macalania shortly.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
They say [Seymor] went<NL>
to Macarena Temple.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Macalania Temple].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Aye.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What I don't get is...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why would the lord maester<NL>
head off without a peep to anyone?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Maybe he wasn't expecting<NL>
[Yuna]'s answer so soon.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Ah, that's probably it.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Yuna], what is it?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Oh, nothing.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Hmm... You're a poor liar.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's true. It's nothing!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Come on, let's go.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Why are you in [Guadosalam]?<NL>
What business have you here?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You wanna start something?<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
If it would please you<NL>
to harm a defenseless old man...<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
then burn me, boil me, it matters not.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Lord [Seymor] is gone.<NL>
No lord rises to take his place.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
The [Guado] merely wait for<NL>
[Sin] to come and finish us off.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Why should I care what you do to me?<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
If it meant rejoining Lord [Jyscal]<NL>
and Lord [Seymor]...<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
then your taking off my head<NL>
would be the greatest kindness.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Come to kill the old man?<NL>
I welcome it!<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Or are you here to laugh?<NL>
Laugh at the fallen [Guado]?<END>

<NL>
A ferocious storm is ripping through<NL>
the Thunder Plains. Please, remain inside.<END>

<NL>
Lord [Seymor] awaits at<NL>
[Macalania Temple]. Please, make haste.<END>

<NL>
None may enter this lordless manor.<END>

<NL>
It is to remain sealed until a new<NL>
lord is chosen to lead the [Guado2].<END>

<NL>
Present yourself to Lord [Seymor]<NL>
before approaching the [Farplane].<END>

<NL>
A guardian abandoning his summoner?<NL>
Most unbecoming.<END>

<NL>
Remember, the [Farplane] is sacrosanct.<NL>
Proper conduct, please.<END>

<NL>
Please refrain from speaking<NL>
of Lord [Jyscal].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We must avoid unseemly rumors<NL>
for the sake of [Spira]'s harmony.<END>

<NL>
Please, leave the matter of<NL>
Lord [Jyscal] to us [Guado].<END>

<NL>
We have no intention of fighting you,<NL>
for we know that we cannot win.<END>

<NL>
Many brave [Guado] have given their lives.<NL>
Now, only a handful remain.<END>

<NL>
Although we [Guado] differ from<NL>
humans in appearance, our respect<NL>
for the dead is the same.<END>

<NL>
People come to [Guadosalam] from every corner<NL>
of [Spira] to see their loved ones again.<END>

<NL>
Why Lord [Jyscal]?<NL>
We gave him such a warm sending.<END>

<NL>
This is most disturbing. We must<NL>
inform Lord [Seymor] at once.<END>

<NL>
We know not what has befallen<NL>
Lord [Jyscal]...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But Lord [Seymor] will soon shed<NL>
light upon this matter.<END>

<NL>
We are simply obeying<NL>
Lord [Seymor]'s orders.<END>

<NL>
Many a Guado met an untimely death<NL>
in the name of Lord [Seymor].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
With most of our youth dead now, the<NL>
future of the [Guado] appears grim indeed.<END>

<NL>
Living with the [Farplane] as we do,<NL>
we [Guado] live with death every day.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We are prepared to face our own<NL>
deaths at [Sin]'s hand.<END>

<NL>
[Sin] embodies death's sheer force.<NL>
After all, no man can stop the inevitable.<END>

<NL>
I suppose you think we look...<NL>
odd, don't you?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
That's fine. We [Guado] are<NL>
used to that sort of thing.<END>

<NL>
But if you ask me, you humans<NL>
look absolutely disgusting.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Still, what does it matter?<NL>
Such nonsense is beneath us, no?<END>

<NL>
Once, a human child simply looked at me<NL>
and then burst into tears. That hurt.<END>

<NL>
Is Lord [Seymor] really going to marry?<NL>
Aww...<END>

<NL>
One of my friends patrols the roads.<NL>
If you meet him, please say hello for me!<END>

<NL>
We lost so many in<NL>
the recent struggles...<END>

<NL>
My best friend walks the [Farplane].<NL>
I...I can't go on like this.<END>

<NL>
I want to go to him...<NL>
To see him on the [Farplane].<END>

<NL>
Humans! Humans!<NL>
A summoner and her guardians!<END>

<NL>
Wait, I know.<NL>
Keeheehee.<END>

<NL>
Lord [Jyscal] came back!<NL>
Don't you find it intriguing?<END>

<NL>
Maybe Lord [Seymor] knows why!<NL>
After all, he is of Lord [Jyscal]'s blood.<END>

<NL>
Don't you need to catch up<NL>
with Lord [Seymor]?<END>

<NL>
Must keep quiet about Lord [Jyscal].<NL>
A grownup said so.<END>

<NL>
Keeheehee!<END>

<NL>
Everyone will die.<NL>
[Guado], humans, [Ronso], and [Al Bhed]!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Only [Sin] will remain,<NL>
forever!<END>

<NL>
Once everyone in [Spira]'s dead,<NL>
it'll get real stuffy on the [Farplane].<END>

<NL>
Keeheehee!<END>

<NL>
We [Guado] protect the [Farplane]<NL>
so the dead can rest in peace.<END>

<NL>
I beg you, please tell no one<NL>
about Lord [Jyscal].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Why, if word leaked out that the lord of<NL>
the [Guado] and a maester of [Yevon2] wandered<NL>
from the [Farplane]...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
we [Guado2] would become the laughingstock<NL>
of all [Spira]! Yevon have mercy upon us.<END>

<NL>
We [Guado2] will solve our own problems.<NL>
Please understand.<END>

<NL>
The [Guado2] are deeply saddened<NL>
by the loss of so many of our own.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If only I could restore their cheer<NL>
through [blitzball].<END>

<NL>
No [Guado2] has the strength<NL>
to weave dark conspiracies any more.<END>

<NL>
Since embracing [Yevon2], we [Guado2]<NL>
have learned the joy that is [blitzball].<END>

<NL>
I hope that the people of [Spira]<NL>
will find peace through [blitz]ball.<END>

<NL>
I want to congratulate Lord [Seymor] on his<NL>
marriage by blitzing like nobody's blitzed before.<END>

<NL>
[Guadosalam] is a natural stronghold.<NL>
No fiends will find their way in here.<END>

<NL>
Lord [Seymor]'s aeon destroyed the<NL>
fiends that appeared in [Luca Stadium].<NEWPAGE>

That display of Lord [Seymor]'s<NL>
raw power struck me speechless.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But it was all a show.<NL>
I feel so...<END>

<NL>
I'm sorry.<NL>
I cannot put it into words.<END>

<NL>
It's called endurance training.<NL>
Stay out of my way.<END>

<NL>
What do you want?<NL>
I'll face you in the sphere pool soon enough.<END>

<NL>
[Luca]'s tournament was completely<NL>
upstaged by [Seymor]'s aeon.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
And by showing support for the excommunicated<NL>
Crusaders, [Seymor]'s popularity is growing fast.<END>

<NL>
First a tribe, then a temple, and now...a bride.<NL>
Everything just falls into [Seymor]'s lap.<END>

<NL>
Now that [Seymor] is dead, no one<NL>
knows who will rise to take his place.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
That means that I still have a chance.<END>

<NL>
Once I lead the [Guado Glories] to victory,<NL>
I will become the next lord here.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Until then, the [Farplane] cannot have me!<NL>
Whatever it takes, I will live to see that day.<END>

<NL>
No one will lord over the [Guado] but me!<NL>
Mwahahaha.<END>
