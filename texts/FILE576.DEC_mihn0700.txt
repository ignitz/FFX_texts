<NL>
My Lady Summoner!<END>

<NL>
You're a summoner?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes.<NL>
My name is [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
I'm Calli.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Nice to meet you, Calli.<END>

Calli<NL>
Lady [Yuna], are you going<NL>
to bring us the [Calm]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes, very soon.<END>

Calli<NL>
Yay!<END>

<NL>
We're looking forward to another<NL>
[Calm], My Lady Summoner.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'll do my best.<END>

<NL>
And good luck to your guardians as well.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's the calm?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The [Calm] is a time of peace.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
It comes after a summoner defeats<NL>
[Sin], and lasts until [Sin] reappears.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Sin] dies and is reborn.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I get it!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I thought it was weird.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna]'s dad defeated [Sin]<NL>
ten years ago, right?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But [Sin]'s still here!<NL>
Didn't make much sense till now.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Wait...<NL>
If it just comes back...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Don't say it isn't worth it...<NL>
Because it is.<END>

<NL>
Even for a little while...<END>

<NL>
people can sleep in their<NL>
beds without being afraid.<END>

<NL>
That kind of time is worth anything.<END>

<NL>
Don't say it isn't worth it.<END>

<NL>
Your words that day, [Yuna]--<NL>
I remember them well.<END>

<NL>
Watch out. There are fiends everywhere.<NL>
Here, you can have this.<END>

<NL>
This ring helps keep flames at bay.<NL>
Please, give it to the lady summoner.<END>

<NL>
I'm watching the [Crusader]s pass by.<NL>
They look cool.<END>

<NL>
Should I become a [Crusader] or a <NL>
blitzer when I grow up? I don't know.<END>

<NL>
My sister's waiting for me, but who cares.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
Hey! That was my ball!<END>

<NL>
Gee, you really socked that puppy.<END>

<NL>
Why don't you become a blitzer?<NL>
Maybe someday you can play for the Goers.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
Whaddya want!<NL>
I'm in a hurry here!<END>

<NL>
They're gonna kill me<NL>
if I'm late for the operation!<END>

<NL>
They won't...be able to...<NL>
defeat [Sin]...without my...<END>

<NL>
Whew...<NL>
At this rate, I'll croak sooner than [Sin].<END>

<NL>
Yes, sir! On patrol, sir!<END>

<NL>
Normally we patrol the area of<NL>
operation with chocobos.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But we couldn't muster the funds<NL>
for any more chocobos.<END>

<NL>
Usually the temple contributes some,<NL>
but not for this operation.<END>

<NL>
I'm sure if we defeat [Sin],<NL>
[Yevon2] will finally bless us.<END>

<NL>
We're raising funds at the end of<NL>
the Highroad. We're counting on you!<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks are real stiffs,<NL>
really unapproachable.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But I am grateful to them for<NL>
guarding the Highroad.<END>

<NL>
A warrior monk got mad at me.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He said I can't play anymore,<NL>
because there are fiends here.<END>

<NL>
I heard so much noise<NL>
during the operation.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Was that the sound of machina?<END>

<NL>
Fiends stalk the area, but people<NL>
just stroll through anyway.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It doesn't make our job any easier.<END>

<NL>
Don't stray off the road.<NL>
Make our job a little easier.<END>

<NL>
I fled [Bevelle] and came here.<NL>
I got sick of living there.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It was so unsettling, what with the priests'<NL>
meddling and the warrior monks' arrogance.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
[Yevon2] had better start<NL>
getting its act together.<END>

<NL>
I'm not playing. I'm practicing<NL>
with my brother.<END>

<NL>
It's important to train.<NL>
You never know what's gonna happen.<END>

<NL>
I have to become strong like my brother<NL>
so that I'll be able to run away like him<NL>
if fiends attack us.<END>

<NL>
My sister wanted to play, so we came here.<NL>
I just didn't expect to see so many fiends.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
I'll have no problems outrunning fiends,<NL>
but I doubt my sister could.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm gonna pray we don't run into any.<END>

<NL>
If there were no fiends in [Spira],<NL>
we wouldn't even have to worry like this.<END>

<NL>
My grandpa and I... We used to take<NL>
a stroll through here almost every day.<END>

<NL>
[Yevon2]'s blessing has granted me sound<NL>
health, but grandpa...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He's been blessed with too much energy.<NL>
He marched on down to go see [Sin].<END>

<NL>
Grandpa said he'd go fetch me a sinscale.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
When he's gonna act his own age,<NL>
I can't say.<END>

<NL>
My brother and I were playing. Then a<NL>
fiend came out, and he ran away without me.<END>

<NL>
He ran so fast.<NL>
My brother is the best!<END>

<NL>
I'm gonna practice running.<NL>
I'm gonna beat my brother someday.<END>

<NL>
I'll protect [Spira] from now on.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
[Sin] beat us last time, but I'm okay.<END>

<NL>
Do you know [Sin]'s weakness?<NL>
Tell me, and I'll kill it for you.<END>

<NL>
If you get attacked by fiends,<NL>
you can come to us for help.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Our prayers are with you.<END>
