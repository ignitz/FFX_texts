<NL>
I thought I sensed my old man there.<END>

<NL>
Somewhere...<END>

<NL>
Or maybe it was just [Sin]'s<NL>
toxin playing tricks on my mind.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
How many died today?<END>

<NL>
People die, and [Yuna] dances.<END>

<NL>
When will she stop dancing?<NL>
When will it stop?<END>

<NL>
[Yuna] won't stop dancing--<NL>
not until [Sin] is gone.<END>

<NL>
Those were my thoughts then...I think.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I see you're still here.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Many stories ended here today...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
But...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Yours goes on, I see.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What?<END>

<NL>
[Sin] had come and gone,<NL>
but I remained here.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
A swift retreat.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Satisfied?<END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
What do you mean?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Those who turned from [Yevon2]<NL>
died, while the faithful live on.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Kinoc]<NL>
The past ten years have<NL>
changed you, I see.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
You do not look so well.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
But now more than ever, you<NL>
must be the people's strength,<NL>
their confidence.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Anyone else would be expected<NL>
to show their sorrow.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
But you...are a summoner.<NL>
You are [Spira]'s hope.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Until [Sin] is defeated, you must<NL>
not relent. Do you understand?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes. I understand.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Are you afraid?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
[Yuna], take me as your pillar<NL>
of strength. As [Yunalesca]<NL>
had her lord [Zaon].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Lady [Yuna].<NL>
Until next we meet, farewell.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Sin] is [Jecht]. <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, for a while there,<NL>
I thought I could feel him.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But that doesn't<NL>
mean I believe you.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Sin] is [Jecht].<NL>
He came here for you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So he killed all those people<NL>
just for a chance to see me?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
That's what [Sin] does.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
He wanted to show that to you.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Do you know why?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How am I supposed to know?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
So you would kill him.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
As long as he is [Sin],<NL>
[Jecht] will keep killing.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
He wants you to stop him.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You gotta be kidding.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How do you know<NL>
all of this, anyway?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm not done talking to you!<NL>
Don't you run away!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
You're the one running.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You were in contact with [Sin] again.<NL>
The toxin--are you okay?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna] was worried about you.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You should let her<NL>
know you're all right.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You can't ignore the teachings.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Rest while you can.<NL>
We leave soon.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Maesters are strict.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I guess...<NL>
I guess I'll just have to do better.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Are you all right?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Hold still.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Thank you, I will.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
I made a bundle with<NL>
the operation prices.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
But the way it turned out,<NL>
they deserved a better deal.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
I guess the summoners<NL>
are our only hope.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Huh? You wanna buy something?<END>

<NL>
W...Water.<NL>
Give me some water.<END>

<NL>
Mom...<END>

<NL>
More than half of our<NL>
frontline soldiers perished.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
My battalion was annihilated, too...<NL>
The [Crusader]s will never rise again.<END>

<NL>
We shouldn't have<NL>
defied the teachings.<END>

<NL>
I'm lucky to be alive.<END>

<NL>
My wounds are nothing compared<NL>
to what the others suffered.<END>

<NL>
It wasn't supposed to end like this.<END>

<NL>
Damn it!<NL>
How many died today?<END>

<NL>
Stupid [Al Bhed]!<NL>
Leaving their junk behind.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We can't get our cart through<NL>
because this thing's in the way.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Now we have to carry everything.<END>

<NL>
How could they leave that crap<NL>
in the middle of the Highroad!<END>

<NL>
I'm offering prayers for all the<NL>
soldiers who lost their lives in<NL>
that futile operation.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
How they must be lamenting on the<NL>
[Farplane] now for renouncing<NL>
the precepts...<END>

<NL>
So many youths have died, all<NL>
because of that [Al Bhed] machina.<NL>
It's heartbreaking.<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks who were<NL>
patrolling the Highroad have left.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They've been ordered to protect<NL>
the palace in [St. Bevelle].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Of course [Bevelle]'s security is<NL>
important too, but who will look<NL>
after our safety now?<END>

<NL>
I wish they'd attend<NL>
to our needs, too.<END>
