<NL>
Hey, there. If you don't buy anything<NL>
from me, you'll regret it.<END>

<NL>
Thanks!<END>

<NL>
Dangerous when shoopuf's close.<NL>
Wants to be shmooshed?<END>

<NL>
Don't touch shoopuf.<NL>
Tailss will be shlapping!<END>

<NL>
Shing the Hymn?<NL>
A very, very myshterious shong indeed.<END>

<NL>
Shoopuf happy now shince<NL>
ebullibody shing shong.<END>

<NL>
There have been reports of<NL>
[Al Bhed] sightings in this area.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Stay alert and keep<NL>
your guard up at all times!<END>

<NL>
The [Al Bhed] have green eyes with a swirl<NL>
pattern. Report any sightings immediately!<END>

<NL>
The [Al Bhed] are roaming this area,<NL>
targeting summoners.<END>

<NL>
Please rest assured,<NL>
the shoopuf is operating as usual.<END>

<NL>
With Yevon in chaos,<NL>
the [Crusader]s must be vigilant.<END>

<NL>
The fight against [Sin] continues.<NL>
Be careful when heading north.<END>

<NL>
Riding the shoopuf is free<NL>
because the temple pays for it.<END>

<NL>
The temple provides for the people.<NL>
We are truly blessed.<END>

<NL>
It seems that Maester [Seymor]<NL>
will be marrying Lord [Braska]'s daughter.<END>

<NL>
With their combined strength,<NL>
Yevon will prosper.<END>

<NL>
What are we to do now that the<NL>
warrior monks are up and gone?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm sure the temple has a plan, but<NL>
Yevon works in strange ways, it seems.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
Me? I obey the temple, without question.<NL>
Who would ever shun the sacred temple!<END>

<NL>
I tried singing the Hymn although I<NL>
didn't know what significance it had.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
There was nothing else to do.<NL>
In times of need, people will try anything.<END>

<NL>
The high priests and the<NL>
summoners will take care of us.<END>

<NL>
You say our machina violate<NL>
the teachings, eh? Nonsense!<END>

<NL>
These machina have Yevon's approval. Don't<NL>
mix them up with the forbidden ones, got it?<END>

<NL>
The maester's engagement is such a<NL>
blessing. It lightens even my spirits.<END>

<NL>
Uh, what happened to Maester [Seymor]<NL>
and Lady [Yuna]'s marriage?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I heard the maester disappeared from<NL>
[Bevelle], and [Yuna] is now a traitor!<NL>
Unbelievable!<END>

<NL>
Careful what you believe, especially<NL>
when such nonsense is floatin' around.<END>

<NL>
I thought that flying ship was<NL>
Yevon's secret weapon...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
but now they're sayin' that<NL>
[Al Bhed] are at the helm!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
You tellin' me that the temple<NL>
and the [Al Bhed] have joined forces?<NL>
Rubbish!<END>

<NL>
Can't believe anything anymore!<NL>
Just pray that [Sin] will go away.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Ten years ago...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
A history lesson?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Jecht] saw his first shoopuf here.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Surprised, he drew<NL>
his blade and struck it.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
He was drunk...<NL>
Thought it was a fiend.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, brother...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
We offered all the money<NL>
we had as an apology.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Jecht] never drank again.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
But, it would seem<NL>
that shoopuf still works here.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Even after ten years,<NL>
[Spira] hasn't changed.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Truly...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
The place seems to resist change.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It would take something unusual.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Don't let the peaceful scenery fool you.<NL>
Be on guard at all times.<END>
