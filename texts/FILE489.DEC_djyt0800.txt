You owe much to your father.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
All these guardians...<NL>
and Sir [Auron], too?<END>

The world must look different when<NL>
you're the daughter of Lord [Braska].<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Oh, is that so?<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Then try standing on your<NL>
own two legs for once.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Your guardians won't be able to<NL>
protect you when the time comes.<END>

This has nothing to do with my father!<END>

I am travelling on my own,<NL>
as a full-fledged summoner!<END>
