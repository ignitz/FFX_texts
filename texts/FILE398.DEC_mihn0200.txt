[Wakka]<NL>
But, this is an [Al Bhed] shop!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Is that a problem?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
They don't believe in [Yevon2],<NL>
and in Luca they... <END>

[Wakka]<NL>
They kidnapped [Yuna]!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Where were her guardians?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sir [Auron]'s just concerned<NL>
about your health.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I'm not tired one bit!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Well I am.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
To the chocobo corral!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Now I know I can count on you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Gimme a break. I just woke up.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Like you did much!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It was your idea to fight that thing.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
If you're always so groggy,<NL>
just stay awake.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah right, thanks for the tip.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Have you an interest in<NL>
renting some chocobos?<END>

[Rin]<NL>
As a token of our gratitude,<NL>
the first time is free of charge.<END>

[Rin]<NL>
Please ask the attendant,<NL>
if you wish to rent.<END>

<NL>
Thank you so much<NL>
for saving the chocobos!<END>

<NL>
Hello!<NL>
No charge this time!<END>

<NL>
You get to ride a chocobo once for<NL>
free, but I see you already have one.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
You can rent one free next time, then.<END>

<NL>
Do you want to ride a chocobo?<END>

<NL>
Do you want me to teach you<NL>
how to ride a chocobo?<END>

<NL>
Please be careful on your trip.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Summoners and guardians!<NL>
I saw the fight. I was impressed!<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Right now we're charged with<NL>
getting people off the Highroad.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
But you... Well, you have a<NL>
have a summoner, so you can stay.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Don't tell anyone,<NL>
but this is a really boring job.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Oh, I took care of<NL>
that fiend for you.<END>

<NL>
Some harsh words have been<NL>
directed at us [Al Bhed] lately.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They say it is our fault that the<NL>
operation failed.<END>

<NL>
I am used to being hated, but now<NL>
I do not feel like working anymore.<END>

<NL>
I am fed up of working with morons.<END>

<NL>
We're keeping an eye on the [Al Bhed2]<NL>
so they don't take advantage of the people.<END>

<NL>
We got off the ship with the children<NL>
under the orders of Elder [Cid].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
The elder probably senses it will be<NL>
a tough battle.<END>

<NL>
I pray for your safety. I do not wish<NL>
harm on any more people.<END>

<NL>
The children are happy.<NL>
Everything is so new to them.<END>

<NL>
I must watch over the children. It is<NL>
dangerous here. They could fall off the cliff.<END>

<NL>
I will be angry if those [Yevon2] monks<NL>
hurt the children.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I do not think they will, but<NL>
I cannot trust them.<END>

<NL>
When I hear the word [Yevon2], I think of<NL>
the [fiend] attack on our [Home].<END>

<NL>
I guess all children are innocent,<NL>
whether they are ours or [Al Bhed].<END>

<NL>
As a [Yevon2] monk, I have denounced the<NL>
[Al Bhed2] for defying the teachings.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
By doing so, I have only stirred senseless<NL>
conflicts throughout [Spira].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I deeply regret my folly.<END>
