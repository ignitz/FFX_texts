area beyond for the duration<NL>
of our operation here.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
You may ask the gate captain up<NL>
ahead if you need to pass through.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
You must first go to the<NL>
end of the Highroad in order<NL>
to get back on the Newroad.<END>

here, and it is our duty to protect<NL>
them from fiends.<END>
