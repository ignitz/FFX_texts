This is the [Temple of Yevon-Djose].<NL>
It is famous for its association with<NL>
Lord [Mi'ihen], founder of the [Crusader]s.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Had he witnessed this dreadful sight...<NL>
Oh, I could just imagine his grief.<END>

<NL>
It is a quiet morning.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Many [Crusader]s departed<NL>
for the [Farplane] last night.<END>

<NL>
Maester [Mika] carried [Spira]<NL>
on his shoulders for fifty years.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm sure he is resting peacefully<NL>
on the [Farplane] now.<END>

<NL>
I wonder who the next grand maester will be.<END>

<NL>
In my youth, I trained with Maester [Jyscal].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We rose above our differences and<NL>
became friends, human and [Guado].<END>

<NL>
We're all out of healing potions.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Even so, more wounded men<NL>
are being brought here.<END>

<Cor 43>Blitz Fan Lv. 1<Cor 41><NL>
Name: Sonio<NL>
Favorite team: [Kilika Beasts]<NL>
He appears to be just an ordinary fan.<NL>
You cannot sign him to a contract.<END>

<NL>
I solemnly pray Lady [Yuna] will become a<NL>
wonderful summoner. Please take care of her.<END>

<NL>
Lady [Yuna] performed the sending all night.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I imagine it must have been quite<NL>
hard on such a young summoner.<END>

<NL>
My fellow monks have left the temple.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They said that nothing will change so long<NL>
as we remain within these confines.<END>

<NL>
I cannot say they are right or wrong.<END>

<NL>
We plan to station warrior monks in<NL>
various locales to prepare for a<NL>
possible raid by fiends and [Al Bhed].<END>

<NL>
Captain, please! Wake up!<END>

<NL>
You were the best, Captain!<NL>
We'll never forget you!<END>
