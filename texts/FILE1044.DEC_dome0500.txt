[Auron]<NL>
We must talk.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
There is something you should know.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I know...it's about you, right?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I am also an unsent.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
You are not surprised?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I think I kinda knew.<NL>
It was [Yunalesca], wasn't it?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
When [Braska] and [Jecht]<NL>
died defeating [Sin]...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I just couldn't accept it.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I came back here...<NL>
tried to avenge them.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
But she struck me down.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Somehow I made my way,<NL>
crawling, down Mount Gagazet.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
But my strength left me<NL>
just outside [Bevelle].<NL>
That's where [Kimahri] found me.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I told him about [Yuna]...<NL>
just before I died.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I've been wandering ever since,<NL>
never going to the [Farplane].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Auron]...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Don't make that face.<NL>
Being dead has its advantages.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I was able to ride [Sin]<NL>
and go to your [Zanarkand].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And you've been watching over<NL>
me since then, haven't you?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's the big idea?<NL>
Why me?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It is one of those things<NL>
that is difficult to explain.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Very well, I will show you.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
My memories.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Can I ask you one last favor?<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Uh...<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Nah. Never mind.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Out with it!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Okay. Listen good.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Take care of my son.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
My son, in [Zanarkand].<NL>
He's such a crybaby.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
He needs someone there<NL>
to hold his hand, see?<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Take care of him, will you?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
But how am I supposed<NL>
to go to [Zanarkand]?<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Hey! You said it yourself!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
There must be a way to<NL>
get there, right? You'll find it.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
All right, I will!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I give you my word.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I'll take care of your son.<NL>
I'll guard him with my life.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Thanks, [Auron].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
You were always such a stiff,<NL>
but that's what I liked about you.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
That is why.<END>
