After you get that<NL>
aeon from [Besaid]...<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Where're we going?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Back the way we came.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Then we go north from<NL>
[Bevelle] and climb [Mt. Gagazet].<END>

[Braska]<NL>
Beyond it lies...[Zanarkand].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
[Zanarkand], huh?<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
It's been in ruins for<NL>
a thousand years, right?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
So the legends say.<NL>
No one knows for sure.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It still could be your [Zanarkand].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Thanks for trying, [Auron].<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I thought if I went with you guys<NL>
I might find a way to go back.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
But it's not that easy.<END>

[Braska]<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
No need to apologize, [Braska].<NL>
It's not your fault.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I should be thinking about<NL>
fighting [Sin] now, anyway.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
[Zanarkand] can wait.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
But I will find my way back!<END>

[Braska]<NL>
Be careful, [Jecht].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Hey, I'll be all right.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
You're the one that should be careful.<NL>
Wouldn't want your little girl to cry.<END>

[Braska]<NL>
She'll be all right.<NL>
She's strong, like her mother was.<END>
