This gorge is called the Scar.<END>

They say that when the high summoner<NL>
cornered [Sin], Sin tore the earth here<NL>
asunder with the last of its strength.<END>

<NL>
The high summoner and [Sin] struck each<NL>
other down at the gorge's bottom. Lord<NL>
Gandof's sacrifice brought us the Calm.<END>

It's simple.<NEWPAGE>

Just get from where you are<NL>

Since you're riding a wild<NL>

<NL>
Everything will be pretty much the same<NL>
as the first exercise, except that your<NL>
chocobo will run straight now.<END>

<NL>
But watch out for incoming balls!<NL>
Dodge them with [Direcional Esquerda] and [Direcional Direita].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Your chocobo will be stunned if he's<NL>

We're near the [Calm Lands] exit to<NL>
[Macalania Woods].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
This is the starting line.<END>

<NL>
And the finish line is the far<NL>
right edge of the plain over there.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Yes, over there.<END>

<NL>
Basically, if you get there<NL>
before I do, you win.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But that's not all.<END>

<NL>
Each balloon you pick up<NL>
along the way shaves three<NL>
seconds off your final time.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But each bird that hits you<NL>
adds three seconds to your<NL>
final time.<END>

<NL>
We take the total time, subtract<NL>
bonuses, and add penalties to decide<NL>
the outcome of the race.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
So even if I reach the finish<NL>
line first, you can still win<NL>
if you catch enough balloons.<END>

<NL>
That's all for now.<NL>

[Lulu]<NL>
The [Calm Lands].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Long ago, the high summoners<NL>
fought [Sin] here.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The road ends here.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Beyond, there're no towns,<NL>
no villages. Only endless plains. <END>

[Auron]<NL>
Many summoners stray from<NL>
their path and lose their way here.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I've always known where to go.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I won't let you die.<NL>
I'll find a way, somehow.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Let's go.<END>

<NL>
I told [Yuna] I would find a way.<END>

<NL>
I guess I wanted to believe that<NL>
words could make it come true.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Father [Zuke]!<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
Long time no see.<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
You are [Yuna]?<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
Hmm...<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
You certainly don't look<NL>
like [Maester Kinoc]'s murderer.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What'd you say?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Please, tell us what has happened!<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
[Maester Mika] just issued<NL>
a personal order, you know.<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
It said that you and your guardians<NL>
murdered [Maester Kinoc] and fled.<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
We are to kill you on sight,<NL>
or so it says.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
What of [Bevelle]?<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
Things are calm on the surface,<NL>
but the depths are turbulent.<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
After the death of [Maester Kinoc],<NL>
[Kelk] [Ronso] left [Yevon2].<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Convenient.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Getting around will be easier<NL>
with [Yevon2] in disarray.<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
But be careful, my friends.<NL>
You have been branded enemies of [Yevon2].<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
You should avoid temples<NL>
for the time being.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thank you, Father [Zuke],<NL>
for your warning.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Father, you came all the<NL>
way here just to tell us this?<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
To tell the truth,<NL>
I was a little curious to see...<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
this summoner you are guarding.<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
I hope her pilgrimage goes well.<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
For your sake, too.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Thank you, Father.<END>

[Zuke]<NL>
I must be off.<NL>
I shall pray for all of you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Who was that?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Until half a year ago,<NL>
he was a summoner.<NL>
[Wakka] and I were his guardians.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It was kind of a short pilgrimage.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
He gave up halfway.<NL>
Here, on this plain.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Now, he is a monk<NL>
at the [Bevelle] temple.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
This is my third<NL>
pilgrimage as a guardian.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Father [Zuke] was my second.<NL>
And my first, well...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
It ended here, too.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I've never been to the lands beyond.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
<Cor 88>[Mt. Gagazet]<Cor 41> towers to the north,<NL>
and <Cor 88>[Zanarkand]<Cor 41> lies beyond that.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
When I was guarding [Zuke]...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I already told you this, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
'Bout when I was too into the<NL>
game to be a good guardian?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
So when Father [Zuke]<NL>
said he wanted out...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Tell you the truth, I was kinda glad.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
<Cor 88>[Zanarkand]<Cor 41>'s right around the corner.<NL>
So close already.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Messy.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What is?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Yevon2].<NL>
[Mika] and [Seymor] are not of one mind.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Remember what [Seymor]<NL>
said last we met.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I do not think [Mika] will concur.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
If [Yevon2] founders,<NL>
so will [Spira].<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
She's not stopping, is she?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna]...she's made her decision.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
But, I can't just let her go.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We won't have to.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We'll save [Yuna] even<NL>
if she calls the Final Aeon.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
But how?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'll think of a way.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
But what if you can't?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm tired of talking to you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's always "but" this, "but" that.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
But...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's think together!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Okay.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And, if we can't think of something...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
we find another way!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Okay!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Ugh... This is a toughie.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Gagazet] is [Ronso] land.<NL>
[Kimahri] home.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey! We might meet your family.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] has no family.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, sorry.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
But [Kimahri] not alone.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Sacred mountain Gagazet.<NL>
Not change for one thousand years.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
So, we are officially traitors, then.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, let them say what they want.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It's okay, I'm not worried.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Well, maybe just a little.<NL>
It's so hard not to be.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, it's okay to worry. And<NL>
if it gets too rough, just yell!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yell? Hmm...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Okay, I might just do that.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I wonder if my father<NL>
got lost here, too?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Maybe, with my old man helping him!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Maybe I'll ask Sir [Auron].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Auron]?<NL>
That grouch never tells me anything.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
"That is none of your business!"<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Not that he keeps out of<NL>
other people's business,<NL>
you know what I mean?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Just a little farther to <Cor 88>[Zanarkand]<Cor 41>.<END>

<NL>
Welcome.<END>

<NL>
What can I do for you?<END>

<NL>
You can ride any of the chocobos<NL>
running around this place for free.<END>

<NL>
But most of them are wild.<NL>
Those won't let you ride them.<END>

<NL>
Wild chocobos aren't bridled.<NL>
That's how you tell them apart.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Perhaps you would like to<NL>
know a bit about these plains?<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
What a pity.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Maechen]<NL>
As you know, these plains<NL>
were once a battlefield.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
A great battle between [Bevelle]<NL>
and [Zanarkand], a melee of machina! <END>

[Maechen]<NL>
That war left this place<NL>
a barren, lifeless land.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Then, time passed.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
The summoners took note<NL>
of this uninhabited land.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Great battles could be fought here,<NL>
with no harm to the common folk.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Perfect for a final battle<NL>
with [Sin], as it were.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Summoners wait here, ready<NL>
to perform the Final Summoning.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Ah, to know what they must feel!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
In any case, when [Sin] is defeated here,<NL>
the [Calm] will visit [Spira] once more.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
That's why this place is<NL>
now known as the [Calm] Lands.<NL>
Exactly who dubbed it so is unknown.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And that, as they say, is that.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Oh dear, I almost forgot<NL>
to tell you something.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
There's a chasm, a great rend<NL>
in the earth, in these parts.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
A scar left from High Summoner<NL>
[Gandof]'s bitter battle with [Sin],<NL>
four hundred years past.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Like to hear about<NL>
this place once more?<END>

<NL>
Traitors should be more cautious.<END>

<NL>
If you go on talking to every<NL>
stranger you meet, one of them<NL>
will call the guards.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Go ahead and call them!<END>

<NL>
After I've just given you a head start?<END>

<NL>
Don't worry, though. I don't pay much<NL>
attention to the temple these days.<END>

<NL>
Like your guardian over there.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Auron]<NL>
Who are you?<END>

<NL>
[Belgemine], a summoner.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Though, I gave up my pilgrimage<NL>
a good many years ago...<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
All I can hope to do now is help<NL>
out a young summoner on her quest--<NL>
if she's willing.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
How about it, [Yuna]?<NL>
I could show you a trick or two.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Perhaps you'd like to test your<NL>
mettle against another summoner?<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Oh, you again. You're quite<NL>
the notorious traitor these days.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's it to you?<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Ah, you shouldn't take what<NL>
the maesters say too seriously.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
For summoners, destroying [Sin]<NL>
is everything. We are no tools<NL>
of [Yevon2], understand?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
So, are you up to the task?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I do not know,<NL>
but I will do my best.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
You've got spirit, but<NL>
you'll need more to beat [Sin].<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
An aeon duel!<NL>
Show me what you're made of.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
No time to fight? I understand.<NL>
I was in your shoes once.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Hmm? Changed your mind?<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Excellent. But before we begin...<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I've just healed your aeons for you.<NL>
Let us begin!<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Impressive.<NL>
Remarkable talent.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Traitor or no, you may have<NL>
what it takes to beat [Sin].<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thank you.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I think you will do just fine.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
But, if you ever feel like<NL>
you want more training, seek<NL>
the hidden temple of Remiem.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I will be waiting there.<NL>
Farewell.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
I hope you will do better<NL>
against [Sin], for your sake.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
You need more training.<NL>
That much is clear, summoner.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
The hidden temple, Remiem.<NL>
I'll be waiting.<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Come, and I will train you.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Th-Thank you!<END>

[Belgemine]<NL>
Focus, and grow strong, [Yuna].<NL>
Farewell.<END>

<NL>
This gorge is called the Scar.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They say that when the high summoner<NL>
cornered [Sin], Sin tore the earth here<NL>
asunder with the last of its strength.<END>

<NL>
The high summoner and [Sin] struck each<NL>
other down at the gorge's bottom. Lord<NL>
Gandof's sacrifice brought us the Calm.<END>

<NL>
In the [Calm Lands], we bury<NL>
our dead in this gorge.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We cannot send them because few<NL>
summoners ever make it this far.<END>

<NL>
I've heard that the dead that don't<NL>
receive a proper sending roam the<NL>
bottom of the gorge as fiends.<END>

<NL>
I have a message from [Cid].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
He says:<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We've gone to repair the [airship].<NL>
We'll come get you when we're done.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Until then, keep [Yuna] safe<NL>
or you'll be sorry, kid.<END>

<NL>
After dropping you off in [Bevelle],<NL>
the [airship] stopped here.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They let all [summoner] off,<NL>
and went for repairs.<END>

<NL>
There ain't no temple on these plains,<NL>
even with [Bevelle] so close by.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Those priests seem to think it<NL>
ain't worth their trouble to come<NL>
out to such a barren place.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But people do live here, you know?<NL>
Ah, they don't care about nothin'<NL>
but their own sweet behinds.<END>

<NL>
We don't need no temple anyway.<NL>
Done just fine so far without one.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Earnest prayer and an honest heart,<NL>
that's what matters.<END>

<NL>
We don't need no temple.<NL>
Done just fine so far without one.<END>

<NL>
Even if I don't know what I'm<NL>

would happen...<END>

<NL>
It's been ages since I could<NL>
get my mind off my job!<NL>
I've gotta thank you.<END>

<NL>
I guess I broke family tradition...<NL>
But nobody saw me, right?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Well, I'd better get back to my watch.<END>

<NL>

I saw the race!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
You were amazing!<NL>
I can't believe you won!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But you were lucky.<NL>
I mean, sometimes she's hot,<NL>
and sometime's she's not.<END>

<NL>
What? Who's watching the gorge?<NL>
Uh, no one.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Shouldn't hurt, right?<END>

<NL>
I hope you're not planning<NL>
to cross this place on foot.<END>

<NL>
I suppose you're right.<NL>
Fighting fiends lets you<NL>
polish your skills.<END>

<NL>
Well, these plains are home to<NL>
lots of wild chocobos.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
First we must train them<NL>
to be dependable mounts.<END>

<NL>
I'm training some chocobos now,<NL>
but they're not quite tame yet.<NL>
I'm sorry I can't lend you any.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Walking might be faster than<NL>
waiting for one of my chocobos.<END>

<NL>
Bye, now. Maybe next time<NL>
I'll have a chocobo ready for you.<END>

<NL>
That's easier said than done.<NL>
It's not that simple, you know.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
You're sure you want to try?<END>

<NL>
Hi there.<NL>
Want to ride a chocobo?<END>

<NL>
All right.<NL>
Come with me.<END>

<NL>
I'm sorry. These things<NL>
take time, you know?<END>

<NL>
You're doing well!<NL>
Keep it up!<END>

<NL>
Oh, you want to train chocobos?<END>

<NL>
Most chocobos around here are<NL>
wild, so you can't ride them<NL>
without training them first.<END>

<NL>
I've trained some chocobos.<NL>
Do you want to ride one?<END>

<NL>
Lost? Follow me if you<NL>
want to go back to [Bevelle].<END>

<NL>
Look, these plains go on forever.<NL>
Take it easy or you'll die out here!<END>

<NL>
Smart travellers like me ride<NL>
chocobos to avoid fiends!<END>

<NL>
Most chocobos around here are wild,<NL>
but a few will let you ride them.<END>

<NL>
Look for chocobos with bridles.<NL>
Those are the ones you want.<END>

<NL>
Chocobos here don't belong to anyone.<NL>
They're free to choose their riders.<END>

<NL>
More and more people are leaving<NL>
[Bevelle]. The temple's finished,<NL>
I say.<END>

When [Sin] fell on [Bevelle],<NL>
I could hear and feel the tremors<NL>
from here!<END>
