[Cid]<NL>
Here we go!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm coming for you, Dad!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I wonder if Sir [Jecht] is in pain.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's just end this...quickly.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The [fayth] said they<NL>
would help us, right?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It bothers me,<NL>
the way they said that.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I mean, they've been fighting<NL>
alongside us this whole time,<NL>
but now they say they'll help?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I guess so...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Wait!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Sin] is reborn when Yu Yevon<NL>
merges with an aeon, isn't<NL>
that right?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
If I summon an aeon,<NL>
Yu Yevon will join with it.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But at first, it'll<NL>
be small, won't it?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Then, we might be able to beat<NL>
it without the Final Summoning.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I don't know. What if<NL>
Yu Yevon jumps again?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Then we'll take it down again!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We'll fight him until<NL>
there's no place left to run!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I never thought it<NL>
would come down to this.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, I know.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, the [fayth], they're<NL>
tired of this whole thing, too.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let's let them rest.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The [fayth] said it's<NL>
pointless to keep dreaming.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The dream will disappear, he said.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What did he mean?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And what is it that Yu Yevon<NL>
is summoning from within [Sin]?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The dream of the [fayth].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You won't...go away, will you?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Yunie]! Guys! Come look!<NL>
Something's happening to [Sin]!<END>
