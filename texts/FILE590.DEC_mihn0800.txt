[Gatta]<NL>
Hey!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Hey, we saw the game!<NL>
You guys were great!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Congratulations, [Wakka]!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
It was close, [Wakka].<END>

[Elma]<NL>
Hey! Stop loafing around!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Uh... The lady summoner<NL>
and her guardians...<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
This mission requires our full attention.<NL>
We've no time to waste!<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Understood?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Yes, ma'am!<NL>
Apologies, ma'am!<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Carry on.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
See? Keep your head down,<NL>
say "sir" a lot, and you'll do fine.<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
Right...sir.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Hey, [Yuna].<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Even though [Yevon2] rejected us...<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
we still believe in you.<NL>
That won't ever change.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thank you, Sir [Luzzu], Sir [Gatta].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But, you know... It's not too late<NL>
for you to go back to [Besaid], and...<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
We should be going, sir!<END>

<NL>
We'll defeat [Sin] any way we can!<END>

<NL>
But [Yevon2]'s teachings say...<END>

<NL>
Enough!<END>

<NL>
I-I only meant to...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Are you all right?<END>

<NL>
Lady Summoner...?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes, I am [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
It is an honor, my lady.<END>

<NL>
My name is [Shelinda].<NL>
I am a disciple of [Yevon2].<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What was all that about?<NL>
The [Crusader]s' operation?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You mean the one [Gatta] and<NL>
[Luzzu] were talking about?<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I heard they were to use forbidden<NL>
machina! I had to stop them.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Huh? Why?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The use of machina is strictly<NL>
forbidden by the [Yevon2] priesthood.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
That's bad, ya?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Let them use whatever they want.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
They still won't defeat [Sin].<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
But, it's not about defeating [Sin]!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
The teachings of Yevon must be upheld!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yeah! Right!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
But you don't understand!<NL>
The [Crusader]s won't even listen to me.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
And it's all because<NL>
I'm just a lowly acolyte.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Don't say that.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Well, I haven't been a summoner<NL>
for very long myself, you see.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Still, I can't put myself<NL>
down every time I fail.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
People are depending on me.<NL>
They're depending on both of us!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Yes! Yes, you're right,<NL>
my lady. Absolutely right!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Thank you so much, Lady [Yuna]!<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
Now I feel I have the courage<NL>
to finish my training.<END>

[Shelinda]<NL>
I will do my best to get myself<NL>
appointed to a temple, as a nun.<END>

<NL>
Here, take this. Just don't tell<NL>
anybody that I was trembling.<END>

<NL>
There are lots of fiends, so stay sharp.<NL>
Use this when the going gets tough.<END>

<NL>
Providing is preventing.<NL>
Need I say more? This'll help.<END>

<NL>
Here's a little something to<NL>
cheer you up before the big fight.<END>

<NL>
I stocked up on too many.<NL>
Please take one, if you like.<END>

<NL>
I join the [Crusader]s and get thrown<NL>
into a major operation right off the bat.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I mean, you can't blame me for<NL>
getting the shakes.<END>

<NL>
I'm not scared. Don't get me wrong.<NL>
I'm just trembling with fury!<END>

<NL>
Do you see that sign?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
What a gaudy ad.<NL>
They're way out of line.<END>

<NL>
It's not good once those guys get going.<END>

<NL>
The young guns believe everything<NL>
will go as planned.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We veterans know otherwise;<NL>
it's not going to be easy.<END>

<NL>
Of course when the time comes,<NL>
we'll march in full force to victory.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Victory must be the goal<NL>
to win any battle.<END>

<NL>
They say luck decides the<NL>
battle, but we can't afford to lose.<END>

<NL>
I'm gonna vanquish [Sin] and<NL>
return home a hero.<END>

<NL>
Us [Crusader]s... We're gonna make<NL>
history with this operation.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
For the first time, people other<NL>
than summoners will defeat [Sin].<END>

<NL>
No doubt we're gonna win. And just in<NL>
case, we have an ace up our sleeves, too.<END>

<NL>
Once the order is given,<NL>
I'll be fighting on the front line.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
That's everything we've trained for.<END>

<NL>
[High Summoner Yocun], who slew [Sin],<NL>
started as a [Crusader].<END>

<NL>
If I fight as valiantly as Lady [Yocun]<NL>
will I, too, receive [Yevon2]'s blessing?<END>

<NL>
Just the other day the [Crusader]s<NL>
marched through here.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Sure is quiet now.<END>

<NL>
I suppose only a summoner can defeat [Sin].<NL>
The teachings are right after all.<END>

<NL>
A quiet, beautiful day, eh?<END>

<NL>
I don't scare much anymore.<NL>
Must be my age.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If [Sin] happens to show up, so be it.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'll just pray as the teachings tell me,<NL>
and go straight to the [Farplane].<END>

<NL>
A quiet, beautiful day, eh?<END>

<NL>
A bunch of wounded [Crusader]s<NL>
passed by moments ago.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They were all hanging their heads,<NL>
crestfallen. It was too painful to watch.<END>

<NL>
Cruel punishment for defying the<NL>
teachings... Too cruel, I'd say.<END>

<NL>
I thought about joining the [Crusader]s, but<NL>
maybe I should join the warrior monks instead.<END>

<NL>
The collapse of the [Crusader]s,<NL>
the conflict in [Bevelle]...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I fear for [Spira]'s future.<END>

<NL>
All we can do is trust the summoners.<NL>
I feel so helpless.<END>

<NL>
Our [Home] was blown to smithreens.<NL>
I am trying not to think about it.<END>

<NL>
It is good to take a walk like this.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Sometimes I catch the rascal who<NL>
scribbles graffiti in [Al Bhed3].<END>

<NL>
You probably do not know what<NL>
I am saying.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I am sorry to waste your time.<END>

<NL>
You look awful depressed,<NL>
and it's such a beautiful day.<END>

<NL>
When I'm feeling down, I come<NL>
here and take a walk.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Nothing like a breath of fresh<NL>
air to clear your mind.<END>

<NL>
There are some things that can't be helped.<END>

<NL>
There are more and more [Al Bhed2]s coming<NL>
here. I don't know if it's good or bad.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
I'm still not comfortable being<NL>
around [Al Bhed].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Maybe I should get to know them,<NL>
but I don't speak the language.<END>

<NL>
Sorry. I don' feel like talking anymore.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
Just leave me alone.<END>

<NL>
I took a bad hit fighting [Sin].<NL>
I couldn't walk for a while.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I'm all good now, and back to<NL>
guarding the Highroad.<END>

<NL>
We couldn't defeat [Sin].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But at least we can protect<NL>
the people from fiends.<END>

<NL>
We should focus on what we can do<NL>
and not dwell on what we couldn't do.<END>

<NL>
Everybody looks calm, but they are<NL>
still afraid of [Sin].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They will always be afraid.<END>

<NL>
I sang aloud to release all of my anxiety.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I was so desperate at the time.<END>

<NL>
I'm gonna sing whenever I see the<NL>
flying ship; I can't help but sing.<END>

<NL>
That flying ship will bring about the Calm.<END>

<NL>
Even for a moment, a fleeting Calm,<NL>
I want to feel peace from my heart.<END>

<NL>
I'm going to live to see the day<NL>
the Calm dawns on us.<END>

<NL>
Fiends often appear here, but<NL>
people pass through here, regardless.<END>

<NL>
[Sin]'s terrible attacks continue, and<NL>
the fiends' threats persist...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Yet people continue to move on.<END>

<NL>
Still, fiends are frightening as always.<END>

<NL>
I wush walking and ended up here.<NL>
Where am I? What plashe ish thish?<END>

<NL>
There ish a shtatue ober there.<NL>
Shtatue of shumone big?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Shtatue like it I've sheen shomewhere elshe.<NL>
Have you sheen it? Or have you not?<END>
