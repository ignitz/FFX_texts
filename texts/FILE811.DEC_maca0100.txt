[Yuna]<NL>
Hmm?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Don't forget to smile, remember?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Oh, you're right.<NL>
I'll try and remember.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Smiling...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Right! Keep at it!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Anything can happen.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
"Make sure you're prepared," right?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
There is a saying:<NL>
"Hurry up and wait."<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It means, prepare quickly so<NL>
you're ready for whatever comes next.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sounds like something<NL>
an old man would say.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Forgive me.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, just being honest!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Can we go now?<NL>
I'm tired of waiting!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna]'s really quiet.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Sitting here like this,<NL>
you really get to thinking.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Temple not far.<NL>
Why stop here?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Seriously...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
A wedding's not supposed<NL>
to make people feel this bad, huh?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Come on, don't say that!<END>

<TEXT>
[Wakka]<NL>
Hmph!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I say what I want,<NL>
ever since I was a kid!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, so you're an adult now?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You know it!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Anyways... How long we supposed<NL>
to stay here, you think?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, don't ask me!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Things've sure gotten complicated<NL>
since Sir [Auron] joined us.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You think so, too?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Still can't figure that guy out.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
I've heard Lady [Yuna] is<NL>
to wed Maester [Seymor].<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
It is great news.<NL>
I'd like to congratulate her.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
But...it is a pity.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
I'd hoped Lady [Yuna] would defeat<NL>
[Sin] and bring the [Calm] to [Spira].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Yuna]'s still gonna journey,<NL>
even after she's married.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
That is also great news!<NL>
Her resolve is admirable!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Would you like<NL>
to hear about Macalania?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Maybe next time.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Go ahead!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Lake Macalania is frozen<NL>
over all through the year.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
It stays frozen even<NL>
on the hottest of days.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
It is said that the temple's<NL>
[fayth] is the cause of this<NL>
fantastic phenomenon!<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
And that is all for today.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Pity.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
Hopefully I can be<NL>
present at the wedding.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
It is not every day that one<NL>
can attend such a joyous event.<END>

[Maechen]<NL>
What is all that ruckus outside?<END>

<NL>
Could the [Al Bhed2] be celebrating the<NL>
wedding, too? It's hard to believe.<END>

<NL>
I heard a flying machina appeared<NL>
in the skies over [Bevelle]! Could<NL>
it really have been the [Al Bhed]?<END>

<NL>
Lady [Yuna]'s wedding is so soon!<NL>
I'm so excited I can hardly sleep!<END>

<NL>
Could it be true that Lady [Yuna] is a<NL>
traitor? Oh, I hope not...<END>

<NL>
The temple destroyed the home of the<NL>
[Al Bhed], I hear. Was such violence<NL>
really called for?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Not that I'm complaining about the<NL>
temple! You heard nothing from me!<NL>
Nothing!<END>

<NL>
The way things are these days, even<NL>
this store isn't safe from attack.<END>

<NL>
[Macalania Temple] is full of those [Guado]<NL>
soldiers. It's a madhouse, I tell you.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I can't even bring myself to go pray<NL>
properly. Things were so quiet before.<END>

<NL>
You look an awful lot like those traitors.<NL>
Take care you don't get mistaken for them!<END>

<NL>
I left the [airship] on<NL>
Elder [Cid]'s orders.<NL>
I wished to be with my family,<NL>
but now I am here against my will.<END>

<NL>
I too can fight!<NL>
Yet I am treated like an infant!<END>

<NL>
They say that [Sin] has fallen on [Bevelle].<NL>
All the [Yevon2] folk are in a panic!<END>

<NL>
I had hoped to help<NL>
Master [Rin] at his shop.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But because I can only speak<NL>
[Al Bhed], he would not hire me.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I now learn your language<NL>
from that kindly shopkeeper.<END>

<NL>
Now we must all employ two tongues,<NL>
as do Master [Rin] and [Rikku].<END>

<NL>
Outside, I felt the white sand with<NL>
my hand and it became most cold!<END>

<NL>
Could this be the snow?<NL>
It is my first time seeing it!<END>

<NL>
When I sang the song outside,<NL>
my breath--it became most white!<END>

<NL>
He is so weak to the cold, he just sits<NL>
there and misses all there is to see!<END>

<NL>
I was playing at sliding on the ice,<NL>
and I almost fell into a big hole!<END>

<NL>
Our new [Home] we should build here!<NL>
Then we can have snow fun every day!<END>
