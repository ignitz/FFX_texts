<NL>
The sun feels great out here.<END>

<NL>
Ah. Kicking back and loafing around<NL>
are the greatest luxuries you can have.<END>

<NL>
You know, it's when I'm just<NL>
lying here like this that<NL>
I realize how wonderful life is.<END>

<NL>
Once [Sin] comes, everything<NL>
we worked for will be lost.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
So why bother to work at all?<NL>
I've got better ways to spend<NL>
the time I have left.<END>

<NL>
Ahh... Basking in the<NL>
sun is such a great luxury.<END>

<NL>
Once [Sin] is gone, I'll clean up<NL>
my act and work more diligently.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I don't think that day<NL>
will ever come, though.<END>

<NL>
You gotta admire them heroes<NL>
on that flying ship. I'll just kick<NL>
back a little extra on their behalf.<END>

<NL>
So I told him right off<NL>
the bat. That'd be cats.<END>

<NL>
You understand, don't you?<END>

<NL>
You're the only one<NL>
that'll listen to me...<END>

<NL>
Youngsters nowadays are so rowdy.<NL>
I can hardly hear myself think in town.<END>

<NL>
I'd rather spend time with my<NL>
dogs than hang around townsfolk.<END>

<NL>
The flying ship is an [Al Bhed] machina, right?<NL>
No way am I going to cheer for them.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They say it was the [Al Bhed]<NL>
that spread those rumors about<NL>
Summoner [Yuna] being a traitor.<END>

<NL>
Cheer for the [Al Bhed2]?<NL>
I'd as soon break the teachings!<END>

<NL>
Both Liki and Winno were...urp.<NL>
L-Let's...ugh...continue this later.<END>

<NL>
They're not as famous...as high<NL>
summoners, but...ugh...later!<END>

<NL>
Did you know...that both were...names<NL>
of great monks...? Th-That's all... <END>

<NL>
G-Give me..a break... Even my trivia...<NL>
won't help me...right now...<END>

<NL>
It's not that...I like riding ships...<NL>
But this...urp...is the only way...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
The waves, winds...and chocobos...cause the<NL>
ship to rock. But it's better than the shoopuf...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Last time, I...urp...on the shoopuf...<NL>
and got an earful...from the Hypello...<END>

<NL>
Ugh... Just talking about it...<NL>
gets me sick... Urrp... H-Help!<END>

<NL>
Watching...flying ship...<NL>
Ugh...got me...seasick.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Thinking...that riding the...flying ship<NL>
would be worse...made me sicker...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Urrrp... D-Don't remind me...<NL>
I feel it coming up...again...<END>

<NL>
Sorry...I couldn't...sing the Hymn...<NL>
Seasick...urrrrp!<END>

<NL>
I was on watch duty all night long.<NL>
Please let me get some sleep!<END>

<NL>
He's fallen asleep.<END>

<NL>
I've been pulling all-nighters<NL>
these days. Please let me rest!<END>

<NL>
Don't worry. I sang the Hymn, too.<NL>
Just...just let me sleep, okay?<END>

<NL>
Don't take what he says literally.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
He tries to sleep on my lap<NL>
whenever he gets a chance.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's starting to hurt my legs.<END>

<NL>
He used to be a hard worker, too.<NL>
But now, he's always like this.<END>

<NL>
Sometimes I wonder why I even<NL>
stay with him at all.<END>

<NL>
He stayed on my lap<NL>
when he sang the Hymn.<END>

<NL>
I'm amazed by his laziness,<NL>
but I'm more amazed at myself<NL>
for forgiving him.<END>

<NL>
They say if you wish upon a<NL>
[Spira] Gull, your wishes come true!<END>

<NL>
What? It's a Lesser Gull, you say?Then my wishes won't...<END>

<NL>
Even if it's a just a Lesser Gull, at least<NL>
half of my wish will come true! Right?<END>

<NL>
I envy how laid back the [Luca]ns are.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They're always crazy about [blitzball],<NL>
even when something terrible happens.<END>

<NL>
I like [blitzball] too, but even<NL>
I can't get that deep into it.<END>

<NL>
Wishing upon a Lesser Gull isn't going<NL>
to make my dreams to come true.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
I wonder what my dreams are anyway?<NL>
I don't really know myself.<END>

<NL>
Being afraid of [Sin] all this<NL>
time, I've had no time to dream.<END>

<NL>
I'm doing a study on<NL>
the animals of [Spira].<END>

<NL>
The birds flying around here are<NL>
Lesser [Spira] Gulls.<END>

<NL>
Lesser Gulls are gentler than Greater Gulls.<NL>
You can tell by the way they fly.<END>

<NL>
I wonder how many of them are flying<NL>
around this ship? I'm curious.<END>

<NL>
Thank you very much.<END>

<NL>
You say you want to help me again?<NL>
Thanks, I'll let you know if I need any.<END>

<NL>
There is a legend that Lesser Gulls carry<NL>
the spirits of the dead to the [Farplane].<END>

<NL>
The Lesser Gulls seem a bit flustered.<NL>
Maybe they feel [Sin]'s presence nearby.<END>

<NL>
I hope that the [Calm] will come soon,<NL>
so I can concentrate on my study.<END>

<NL>
Yes. Now go count.<END>

<NL>
That's about what I thought.<NL>
It's the same as I counted earlier.<END>

<NL>
Thanks to you, I have a confirmed count.<NL>
Here, this is for your help.<END>

<NL>
Are you sure?<NL>
Weren't there more than that?<END>

<NL>
Are you sure?<NL>
I think that's too much.<END>

<NL>
Say, can you do a recount?<NL>
I really need an accurate figure.<END>

<TEXT>
<NL>
[Direcional Cima]: Increase<NL>
[Direcional Baixo]: Decrease<NL>
[Botão Círculo]: Confirm<END>

<NL>
It was a mistake to take work on<NL>
the Winno just because it pays well.<END>

<NL>
Day and night, it's been work,<NL>
work, work. Give me a break!<END>

<NL>
My gramps always said, a man can<NL>
only work so much in a lifetime.<END>

<NL>
Gramps was a real hard worker, though.<END>

<NL>
My night shift has been doubled by<NL>
the captain's orders. Doubled!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
There's no way I can do that! Just hire<NL>
more hands if you want more work done.<END>

<NL>
There's no use griping, but sometimes<NL>
that's the only thing I can do.<END>

<NL>
We're rooting for that flying ship.<NL>
Our lives depend on it!<END>

<NL>
Hopefully there will be less work<NL>
for watch duty once [Sin]'s defeated.<END>

<NL>
Use the lower decks to sleep and rest.<NL>
We'll get there by the time you wake up.<END>
