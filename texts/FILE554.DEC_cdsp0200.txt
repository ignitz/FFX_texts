[Lulu]<NL>
I hope you hurt them.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
A little.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What is it?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
There were these [Al Bhed] that saved<NL>
my life when I first came to [Spira].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
They took me on their ship,<NL>
even gave me food.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I was kinda hoping this was<NL>
the same ship. But it's not.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I wonder if they're all gone.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What happened?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Sin] came up near us.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I made it out okay, but I don't know<NL>
what happened to their ship.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Um, was there anyone<NL>
called Cid on that ship?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I don't know. They were all<NL>
speaking that [Al Bhed] language.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I see...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So who's [Cid]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
He's my uncle, but I've<NL>
never actually met him.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Wait.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
That means you're<NL>
[Al Bhed], too, [Yuna]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
On my mother's side, yes.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
[Cid] is my mother's brother.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
He became distant<NL>
after my mother married.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But she told me to seek him<NL>
out if I ever needed help.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You're worried he was...?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Don't tell [Wakka]<NL>
about [Yuna]'s lineage.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The thing about [Wakka]--he never<NL>
had much love for the [Al Bhed].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whoa!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I gotta tell [Wakka]!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I thought I told you<NL>
not to tell [Wakka]!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
The game!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Oh!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
          <END>
