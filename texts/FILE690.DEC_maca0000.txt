My lady?<END>

even if I marry.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Do you think that Maester<NL>
[Seymor] would let me?<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
But of course, my lady.<END>

Would you look at this?<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
They always leave me behind.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Oh. You want me to scratch you?<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
There. Good boy!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
How'd you know what it wanted?<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I've always been able<NL>
to tell how chocobos feel.<END>

Maybe I'd make a better chocobo<NL>
breeder than Chocobo Knight, huh?<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Hey, what job do<NL>
you see me doing?<END>

<TEXT>
<CHOICE1>Chocobo Knight.<NL>
<CHOICE2>Chocobo Breeder.<END>

Yeah! I think so too!<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Hmm...<NL>
You know, I might just give it a try.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
We'll have to get some<NL>
new chocobos to rebuild our unit.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I wonder how long<NL>
that's gonna take. Ah, well...<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Should I resign my commission?<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Would Captain [Lucil] let me?<NL>
[Elma] would probably laugh at me.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Wow, I think this is the first time<NL>
I've seriously thought about my life.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I should be fighting,<NL>
but my legs refuse to move.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I don't deserve to<NL>
be a Chocobo Knight.<END>
