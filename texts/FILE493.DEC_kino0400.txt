[Yuna]<NL>
Hey, you two! Hurry up!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
She's awfully cheerful.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
In dark times she must be.<NL>
She must shine bright.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Now are dark times.<NL>
[Yuna] tries hard.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We should help her, then.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
If we worry, she tries harder.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Do not frown.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Don't worry, be happy?<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] try, too.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Smile! Let me see.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey! How much longer<NL>
till [Zanarkand]?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Still a ways.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
First down the [Moonflow] to<NL>
the [Guado] city of [Guadosalam]...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Then we cross the [Thunder Plains]<NL>
to the temple of Macalania.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, boy.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
And before that, we get to pray<NL>
at the temple in <Cor 88>[Djose]<Cor 41>!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We can't just skip all<NL>
that? Can we, huh?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I have to pray to the [fayth] in every<NL>
temple in order to earn the Final Aeon.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
That's a summoner's training.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
She's gotta prepare mind and body, all<NL>
just to get ready for the Final Summoning.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Must be tough, [Yuna].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I'll be fine with you here!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Hey, new guy.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh...me?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Who else?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What can I do for you, boss?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Don't tell [Yuna] you<NL>
know about [Sin] and [Jecht].<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Auron]<NL>
You know her...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
She would...distance<NL>
herself from you.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
We do not want that.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I see, I think.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, but even if I did<NL>
say something, no one<NL>
would believe me, you know?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Yuna] would.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Ah...you have a point.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Better than you finding out at a<NL>
critical moment, becoming emotional.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What? Me, emotional?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I heard you were quite the crybaby.<END>

<NL>
Yeah, maybe when I was a kid.<END>

<NL>
Maybe even a little now.<NL>
Just a little.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I still don't buy<NL>
your story, you hear?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Where to next?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
We cross the <Cor 88>[Moonflow]<Cor 41>.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Gotcha!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
<Cor 88>[Moonflow]<Cor 41>, baby,<NL>
here we come!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Come to think of it...did I really<NL>
have to know about [Jecht]?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What about my feelings?<END>

<NL>
We've decided to rest at the temple.<NL>
I just hope they let us.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
We've been excommunicated, after all.<NL>
They might throw us out.<END>

<NL>
Oh, I almost forgot.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
There are fiends here that petrify<NL>
humans. Wear this; it should help.<END>

<NL>
My buddy's missing. We served<NL>
in the same unit. I hope he's okay.<END>

<NL>
My comrades are dead, all because<NL>
we ignored the teachings.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Relying on a forbidden machina...<NL>
What the heck were we thinking?<END>

<NL>
This'll hardly make amends, but...<NL>
I want the lady summoner to have this.<END>

<NL>
I guess it's time to seek the monks' help<NL>
and embrace the teachings once again.<END>

<NL>
We incurred heavy casualties in last<NL>
year's [Djose] coast defense operation.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But even those losses<NL>
don't compare to this.<END>

<NL>
I found this lying on the battlefield.<NL>
Maybe it will be of some use to you.<END>

<NL>
All I can offer now are my prayers.<END>

<NL>
[Sin]'s attack has aggravated the fiends.<NL>
I advise against going to [Luca].<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s have been ordered<NL>
to regroup at [Djose Temple].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Not many left to regroup, but...<END>

<NL>
It's my fault. My men died in vain<NL>
because of me. It's all my fault.<END>

<NL>
My sergeant's keepsake... Take it.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
Supposedly, the warrior monks and the<NL>
[Guado2] will guard the Highroad now.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Pretty soon they won't need the<NL>
[Crusader]s around here at all.<END>

<NL>
I'll stay on to guard the Highroad,<NL>
even without my fellow [Crusader]s.<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks have returned to<NL>
[Bevelle]. In other words, they fled.<END>

<NL>
Rumor has it that [Sin] will<NL>
return to this place someday.<END>

<NL>
Unbelievable! A flying ship that sings!<NL>
My jaw dropped when I saw it.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
A huge crowd gathered along the Highroad,<NL>
and they all sang along, arm in arm.<END>

<NL>
So if we defeat [Sin], our crimes<NL>
will be forgiven, right? Right!?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
That time I stole that kid's...<NL>
And the other time when I...<NL>
All will be forgiven?<END>

<NL>
As followers of [Yevon2], we believe<NL>
in aiding all those who are wounded.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Even the excommunicated [Crusader]s.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They have suffered so much. I believe<NL>
the time has come to welcome them back.<END>

<NL>
May [Yevon2]'s blessing be with you.<END>

<NL>
A heartbreaking defeat, it was...<NL>
[Yevon2]'s blessing has spared us.<END>

<NL>
There are some suspicious [Al Bhed2]<NL>
prowling around the Highroad.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But then again, I've never met an<NL>
[Al Bhed2] that wasn't suspicious!<END>

<NL>
Please notify me if you<NL>
run into any [Al Bhed2].<END>

<NL>
What in [Spira] are you doing here?<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Maester [Seymor] is expecting<NL>
you in [Macalania].<END>

<NL>
We must spread news of the<NL>
wedding to all of [Spira].<END>
