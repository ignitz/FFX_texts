[Tidus]<NL>
Blitzball!<END>

<NL>
Hey!<NL>
You okay?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Heeey!<END>

<NL>
Whoa-ho!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yo! Hiya!<END>

<NL>
You wanna try that<NL>
move one more time?<END>

<NL>
Finally, things were<NL>
starting to look up.<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
You're no amateur.<NL>
Who you play for?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The [Zanarkand Abes]!<END>

<NL>
<END>

<NL>
What team you say again?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh, I meant...<NL>
Forget that.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I got too, uh...close to [Sin]<NL>
and my head's all foggy-like.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So I don't know where this place is.<NL>
Or even where I came from.<END>

<NL>
[Sin]'s toxin got to you.<END>

<NL>
But, you're still alive.<END>

<NL>
Praise be to [Yevon2]!<END>

<NL>
All right, back to practice!<END>

<NL>
I'm [Wakka], coach and captain<NL>
of the [Besaid Aurochs], brudda.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What?<NL>
You hungry?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Okay! Back to the village.<NL>
I'll get you somethin'!<END>

<NL>
I felt like I could trust this<NL>
[Wakka], so I just had to ask.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Long time ago, there were a whole<NL>
lot of cities in [Spira]. Big cities<NL>
with machina--machines--to run 'em.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
People played all day and<NL>
let the machina do the work.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
And then, well, take a look.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Sin] came, and destroyed<NL>
the machina cities.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
And [Zanarkand] along with 'em.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yeah, that was about a thousand<NL>
years ago, just like you said.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
If you ask me, [Sin]'s our punishment<NL>
for letting things get out of hand.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What gets me, though...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
is we gotta suffer, 'cause of what<NL>
some goofballs did way back when!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
'Course, we must always repent<NL>
for our sins! That's important!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It's just that, it's hard to<NL>
keep at it sometimes, you know?<END>

<NL>
It was just as [Rikku] said.<END>

<NL>
[Wakka] and [Rikku] couldn't both<NL>
be lying. Why would they?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But you from the [Zanarkand Abes]--<NL>
that was a good one!<END>

<NL>
I appreciated the fact that<NL>
[Wakka] was trying to cheer me up.<END>

<NL>
But at that time, all<NL>
I could think about was...<END>

<NL>
everything that happened to<NL>
me--all this--started with [Sin].<END>

<NL>
Maybe if I could find [Sin]<NL>
one more time, I could go home!<END>

<NL>
For now, I'd just live life until<NL>
that time came. No more worrying<NL>
about where, or when, I was.<END>

<NL>
Sure it was hard not to think of home.<NL>
But I started to feel better already.<END>

<NL>
A little better...maybe.<END>

Datto<NL>
I gotta stop closing my eyes<NL>
when the ball comes down.<END>

Datto<NL>
That toxin's nasty stuff, ya?<NL>
You should go rest up.<END>

Datto<NL>
What am I saying?<NL>
Take this, it might help!<END>

Datto<NL>
You being a blitzball player's<NL>
probably what saved you out there.<NEWPAGE>
Datto<NL>
The best players--they can<NL>
hold their breath, like, forever!<NEWPAGE>
Datto<NL>
I wish I could do that.<END>

Datto<NL>
We had an underwater race once, ya?<NL>
To see how long we could go.<NEWPAGE>
Datto<NL>
Two laps and we were out, but <NL>
Cap'n [Wakka] went five, no sweat!<END>

Letty<NL>
I can head the ball pretty good.<NL>
Today's just a bad day, ya?<END>

Letty<NL>
This is really weird, ya?<NL>
I could do five in a row yesterday!<END>

Letty<NL>
I'm nowhere near Cap'n [Wakka],<NL>
but I can hold my own underwater, ya?<NEWPAGE>
Letty<NL>
It's just that...<NL>
I'm not so good with the ball.<END>

Letty<NL>
It true that the best players<NL>
can even sleep underwater?<NEWPAGE>
Letty<NL>
Man, that's like...superhuman, you know?<END>

Jassu<NL>
That shot was spectacular, brudda!<NL>
Wish I could shoot like that.<END>

Jassu<NL>
Cap'n [Wakka]'s waiting for you.<NL>
You better get going, ya?<END>

Jassu<NL>
There's fiends on the road, ya?<NL>
Use this if you get in trouble.<END>

Botta<NL>
I really want to make Cap'n [Wakka]<NL>
proud at this year's tournament.<END>

Botta<NL>
Come practice with us once<NL>
the toxin wears off, okay?<END>

Botta<NL>
Hope you get better soon, brudda.<END>

Keepa<NL>
Hey, I'll admit it. We're<NL>
not the best blitzers in Spira.<END>

Keepa<NL>
"To do our best!" That's our motto.<NL>
Guess it's not enough, though.<END>

Keepa<NL>
Here, take this.<NL>
And do your best, ya?<END>

Keepa<NL>
We're always top dogs for the<NL>
first few minutes of the game, ya?<NEWPAGE>
Keepa<NL>
Then we start to run out of breath.<NL>
That's when they get us.<NEWPAGE>
Keepa<NL>
But Cap'n [Wakka], man,<NL>
he don't stop!<NEWPAGE>
Keepa<NL>
No halftime breath for him, ya?<NL>
He just keeps going!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Hey, I'm not saying the<NL>
team never existed, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But you gotta figure a team livin' in<NL>
luxury like that'd be pretty soft, eh?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It's true [Zanarkand] was destroyed,<NL>
right? A thousand years ago?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So it's just a big pile<NL>
of rubble now, isn't it?<END>
