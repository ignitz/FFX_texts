[Auron]<NL>
Stand back.<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Thank you!<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
Lady [Yuna]!<END>

<NL>
[Rikku]!<END>

<NL>
Don't interfere<NL>
or you get this!<END>

<NL>
Your precious [magic]<NL>
and [aeons] are sealed!<END>

<TEXT>
[Rikku]<NL>
Oh, no!<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Translation?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
He's gonna use an<NL>
anti-magic field on us!<END>

<NL>
Get them!<END>

[Tromell]<NL>
My lady!<END>

<NL>
I will tell Father!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I am the [guardian]<NL>
of [Yuna], you see?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Yuna] is safe! We will<NL>
guard her! She is safe!<END>

<NL>
You do this alone, sister!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I told him I was a guardian.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Well, guess I had to, really.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
How come you speak [Al Bhed]?<END>

<TEXT>
[Wakka]<NL>
Why?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Because I'm [Al Bhed].<NL>
And that...was my brother.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You knew?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why didn't you tell me?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
We knew you'd be upset.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
This is great.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I can't believe I've been travelling<NL>
with an [Al Bhed]! A heathen!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You're wrong! We have<NL>
nothing against [Yevon2].<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But you [Al Bhed] use<NL>
the forbidden machina!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You know what that means?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Sin] was born because<NL>
people used machina!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You got proof?<NL>
Show me proof!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
It's in [Yevon2]'s teachings!<NL>
Not that you'd know!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
That's not good enough!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Yevon2] says this,<NL>
[Yevon2] says that.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Can't you think for yourself?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Well, then you tell me!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Where did [Sin] come from, huh?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I...I don't know!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You bad-mouth [Yevon2] and that's<NL>
all you can come up with?<END>

<TEXT>
[Rikku]<NL>
But...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
that doesn't mean you should do<NL>
whatever they say without thinking!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Nothing will ever change that way!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Nothing has to change!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You want [Sin]<NL>
to keep coming back?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
There might be a way<NL>
to stop it, you know!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Sin] will be gone once we<NL>
atone for our past mistakes!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
When? How?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
If we keep faith in [Yevon2]'s<NL>
teachings it will be gone one day!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Why do I even bother?<END>

<TEXT>
[Auron]<NL>
[Rikku]!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Will this move?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We're not using that, are we?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Wait... Sir [Auron] isn't<NL>
[Al Bhed] too, is he?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Come on, [Wakka]...<END>

<TEXT>
[Wakka]<NL>
What?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I mean, getting angry just 'cause<NL>
you found out [Rikku]'s an [Al Bhed]...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You guys got along fine<NL>
till now, didn't you?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
That's different. I mean...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, I don't claim to<NL>
know that much about [Spira].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And I probably know even less<NL>
about the [Al Bhed], but...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I know [Rikku]'s a good person.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
She's just [Rikku]!<END>

<TEXT>
[Wakka]<NL>
Lu?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Just think of this as an opportunity<NL>
to learn more about the [Al Bhed].<END>

<TEXT>
[Wakka]<NL>
Ha!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Let him go.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Give him time to think.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You've done nothing to apologize for.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
All right! Let's ride!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You sure you<NL>
know how to drive this?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Better than [Kimahri] does!<END>
