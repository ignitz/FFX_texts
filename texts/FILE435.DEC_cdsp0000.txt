[Tidus]<NL>
Whoa... Okay.<END>

<NL>
Do you not speak?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Right. Whatever.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I said I don't understand!<END>

<NL>
Insolence!<END>

<NL>
Wait!<END>

<NL>
He said you can stay<NL>
if you make yourself useful.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You...You understand me?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
All right, I'll work!<END>

<NL>
Oh, almost forgot!<END>

<NL>
Okay! Let's get to work!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's this?<NL>
Some kind of crane?<END>

<NL>
Hey, you!<NL>
Get away from there!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
All right, all right!<NL>
You don't have to shout!<END>

<NL>
We found the [airship]!<END>

<NL>
The records were right.<END>

<NL>
Now, how to drag it up?<END>

<NL>
You, outside!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, I helped out, didn't I?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uhh...hungry.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whoa! Right on!<END>

<NL>
It's 'cause you eat too fast!<END>

<NL>
Hey!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hello there. What is your name?<END>

<NL>
[Rikku].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whoa! You really do understand!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why didn't you say so earlier?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I didn't get a chance to!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Everyone thought oui were a fiend.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh..."we"?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Oh, "oui" means "you."<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Who are you guys, anyway?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
We're [Al Bhed]. Can't you tell?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Wait. You're not an<NL>
[Al Bhed]-hater, are you?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I don't even know<NL>
what an [Al Bhed] is.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Where are you from?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Zanarkand].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'm a [blitzball] player.<NL>
Star player of the<NL>
[Zanarkand Abes]!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Did you hit your head or something?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Um, you guys hit me.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Oh, right... Do you remember<NL>
anything before that?<END>

<NL>
So I told her everything there was to tell<END>

<NL>
about [Zanarkand]...<END>

<NL>
About life there, [blitzball],<NL>
and [Sin]'s attack...<END>

<NL>
and about how [Auron] and I<NL>
were engulfed in this light.<END>

<NL>
I just said things as they came to mind.<NL>
But then I started to wonder.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Did I say something funny?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You were near [Sin].<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Don't worry,<NL>
you'll be better in no time.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
They say your head gets<NL>
funny when [Sin] is near.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Maybe you just had<NL>
some kind of dream?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You mean I'm sick?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Because of [Sin]'s toxin, yeah.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You sure?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Yeah, there is no [Zanarkand] anymore.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Sin] destroyed it<NL>
a thousand years ago. <END>

[Rikku]<NL>
So...no one plays [blitzball] there.<END>

<NL>
<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What do you mean,<NL>
a thousand years ago?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But I saw [Sin] attack [Zanarkand]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You're saying that happened<NL>
a thousand years ago? No way!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You said...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You play [blitzball]?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You know, you should go to [Luca].<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Someone might know<NL>
who you are, or you<NL>
might find<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
someone you recognize.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Luca]?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Okay, leave it to me!<NL>
I'll get you to Luca, promise!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You'd rather stay here?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Okay, I'll go tell the<NL>
others. Wait here.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Oh, and one thing.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Don't tell anyone you're<NL>
from [Zanarkand], okay?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Yevon2] says it's a holy place.<NL>
You might upset someone.<END>

<NL>
My [Zanarkand], some kind of holy place?<NL>
Yeah right, I thought.<END>

<NL>
Since when?<END>

<NL>
[Yevon2]? [Sin]? [Luca]?<END>

<NL>
I thought [Sin] just took me to a<NL>
faraway place, that I could go<NL>
back in a day or two.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But a thousand years<NL>
into the future?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No way!<END>

<NL>
[Sin]!<END>

<NL>
[Sin] is come!<END>

<NL>
Under us! Under us!<END>

<NL>
Move it!<NL>
Get to work, immediately!<END>

<NL>
Go on, earn your pay.<END>

<NL>
If you're near death,<NL>
really near death, use this!<END>

<NL>
You afraid of the sea?<NL>
Weakling!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
          <END>

<NL>
We found some ancient ruins<NL>
right beneath us.<END>

<NL>
It's not active now, but there<NL>
should still be some power left.<END>

<NL>
We're gonna go down<NL>
there and activate it...<END>

<NL>
and then we should be able to<NL>
salvage the big prize!<END>

<NL>
We'll go as soon as you're ready!<END>
