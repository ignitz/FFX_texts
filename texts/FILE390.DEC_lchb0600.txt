<NL>
People from all over [Spira]<NL>
gather here.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
The monks of [Yevon2], the [Al Bhed2],<NL>
[Crusader]s, warrior monks, [Ronso],<NL>
[Guado], you name it.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
People of different cultures and<NL>
values come together as one to<NL>
cheer on blitzball.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
There is no other place in [Spira]<NL>
as wonderful as this.<END>

<NL>
There hasn't been any major incident since<NL>
the fiend attack. Just kids who get lost<NL>
in the stadium now and then.<END>

<NL>
We no longer have the strength<NL>
to fight...<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Should the fiends reappear, run<NL>
for your lives!<END>

<NL>
Thanks to the citizens' pitching in, the<NL>
stadium has been repaired in no time.<END>

<NL>
Please do not throw objects or lean<NL>
against the railing at any time!<END>

<NL>
Sphere pictures are allowed, but<NL>
please refrain from using a flash.<END>

<NL>
The crowd and the players went wild<NL>
when the ship flew by!<NL>
It was a struggle to keep 'em under control.<END>

<NL>
The warrior monks have left, but the<NL>
[Crusader]s are back to help guard the area.<END>

<NL>
I don't want the warrior monks stationed<NL>
inside the stadium. They're too uptight.<END>

<NL>
The fiends broke in, all because the<NL>
[Crusader]s ditched guard duty this year.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It's all their fault! They should<NL>
have been helping us instead of<NL>
devising some foolish plan!<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s are dreamin'!<NL>
Do they really think the operation will succeed?<END>

<NL>
Even though the grand maester<NL>
is here, we're short on security.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
If only the [Crusader]s were<NL>
still here like last year...<END>

<NL>
Everyone in [Spira] has been looking<NL>
forward to this tournament.<NL>
No one would dare disrupt it.<END>

<NL>
Such a free-spirited city...<NL>
I do not wish to return to Bevelle.<END>

<NL>
I'm off duty.<NL>
Let me be.<END>

<NL>
Nothing beats watching a blitz game<NL>
after a long stint at sea.<END>

<NL>
Since games are played every day,<NL>
the guards are always on duty.<END>

<NL>
Incompetent guardians! That's why so many<NL>
summoners are vanishing, I tell you.<END>

<NL>
I heard [Master Seymor] helped kill off<NL>
some [sinspawn] at [Operation Mi'ihen].<END>

<NL>
Even with the recent fiend scare,<NL>
I can't believe how crowded it is.<END>

<NL>
It's too bad the [Aurochs]' record<NL>
losing streak had to end. That was<NL>
the only thing going for them.<END>

<NL>
Those fiends really put a<NL>
damper on the tournament.<END>

<NL>
I was watching [Master Seymor]'s<NL>
aeon from here. It was awesome!<END>

<NL>
Games are held every day,<NL>
even after the tournament.<END>

<NL>
[Maester Mika2] has already<NL>
returned to [Bevelle].<END>

<NL>
[Wakka]'s pretty beat up.<NL>
I don't think he'll play in the finals.<END>

<NL>
Looks like the [Aurochs] are burnt out.<NL>
They don't stand a chance in the finals.<END>

<NL>
I must be dreaming.<NL>
The [Aurochs] are in the finals?<END>

<NL>
What are you doing out here?<NL>
You should be out there by the<NL>
bench cheering on your teammates!<END>

<NL>
No need to watch this match.<NL>
We all know the [Aurochs] are<NL>
gonna lose the first round anyway.<END>

<NL>
Why aren't you out there playing?<NL>
You're pretty confident for an [Aurochs] player.<END>

<NL>
I've decided to stay in [Luca] until<NL>
the Calm comes. The more, the merrier<NL>
when it comes to celebrations.<END>

<NL>
There's a flying ship by the dock.<NL>
When do you think it'll fight [Sin]?<END>

<NL>
So many people...<NL>
Much more than in the [Calm Lands].<END>

<NL>
I've seen many things in my time at sea, but<NL>
nothing like that flying ship at dock number 1.<END>

<NL>
Only the [Guado2] and the warrior monks<NL>
are guarding the streets. Why aren't<NL>
they asking the [Ronso] for help?<END>

<NL>
I hope watching the game will ease the<NL>
Crusaders' pain over their dreadful defeat.<END>

<NL>
[Ronso] warriors value their horns, and<NL>
the people of [Luca] value blitzball.<END>

<NL>
True believers of the teachings<NL>
will not support the [Crusader]s.<END>

<NL>
Many [Ronso] have left [Luca] to guard<NL>
their sacred mountain, [Gagazet].<END>

<NL>
Throughout the long history of [Yevon2],<NL>
this is the first time a summoner has<NL>
ever been appointed maester.<END>

<NL>
You have to admire the [Aurochs]' fighting spirit.<NL>
But the [Ronso] warriors deserve some credit, too.<END>

<NL>
The [Aurochs]' victory must be a<NL>
blessing from [Yevon2].<END>

<NL>
Those [Al Bhed] players are playing well.<NL>
You can tell they're hungry for the championship.<END>

<NL>
The Psyches and the [Aurochs] are<NL>
not enemies of the [Ronso Fangs].<END>
