The [fayth] do not live, thus<NL>
we cannot die. Yet we are not<NL>
dead, so we cannot live.<END>

Fayth<NL>
All we can do...is dream.<END>

Fayth<NL>
We've been dreaming so long...<NL>
we're tired.<END>

Fayth<NL>
Would you and your father...<NL>
Would you let us rest?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Let you rest?<END>

Fayth<NL>
Both you and your father<NL>
have been touched by [Sin].<END>

Fayth<NL>
[Sin], the one around whom all<NL>
[Spira]--the spiral--revolves.<END>

Fayth<NL>
You two are more<NL>
than just dreams now.<END>

Wake up!<NL>
Wake up, please!<END>

Maybe you are the dream<NL>
that will end our dreaming at last.<END>
