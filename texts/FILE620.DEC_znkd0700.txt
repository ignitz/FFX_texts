[Auron]<NL>
Is she all right?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why should you care?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
If she dies,<NL>
I wouldn't know what to do.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Don't say Mom is gonna die!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I apologize.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
See? So I told him what I<NL>
thought of him, right there!<END>

<NL>
Really?<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
'Course!<END>

<NL>
I suppose, but...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Mommy...<END>

<NL>
Just a sec, dear.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Ah, go to him.<NL>
He'll cry if you don't.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Whenever my old man was around,<NL>
my mother wouldn't even look at me.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Maybe that's...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Maybe that's when I started<NL>
to resent him, even hate him.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
When he left us...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Mom just lost her energy.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The old lady next door told me...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
when a lovebird dies,<NL>
the one left behind...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It just gives up living<NL>
so it can join its mate.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It was just like that.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I hated my old man even more.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But really, my old man...<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
What?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
They say you don't practice<NL>
anymore, that you're gonna retire.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Let them talk.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I'm still the best.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
They say you're no good<NL>
'cause you drink all the time.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I can quit drinkin' whenever I want!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Then do it now.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
What did you say?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You just said you can!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Heh.<NL>
Tomorrow, maybe.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why not today?<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Why do today what<NL>
you can leave for tomorrow?<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
There he goes again...crying!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Zanarkand]...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You homesick, too?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
That's not your world anymore.<NL>
You're [Sin] now.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey,<NL>
I'm older now, you know?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I know.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You want this to end.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'll find a way, promise.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Eh?<END>

Fayth<NL>
Long ago, there was a war.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah, with machina, right?<END>

Fayth<NL>
Yes. A war between<NL>
[Zanarkand] and [Bevelle].<END>

Fayth<NL>
[Bevelle]'s machina assured their<NL>
victory from the start.<NL>
Spira had never seen such power.<END>

Fayth<NL>
The summoners of [Zanarkand]<NL>
didn't stand a chance.<END>

Fayth<NL>
[Zanarkand] was<NL>
doomed to oblivion.<END>

Fayth<NL>
That's why we tried to save<NL>
it--if only in a memory.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What did you do?<END>

Fayth<NL>
The remaining summoners and the<NL>
townspeople that survived the war...<END>

Fayth<NL>
They all became [fayth]--<NL>
[fayth] for the summoning.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The summoning...<NL>
You mean [Sin]?<END>

Fayth<NL>
No. I mean this place.<END>

Fayth<NL>
A [Zanarkand] that never sleeps.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What?<END>

Fayth<NL>
The dreams of the [fayth]<NL>
summoned the memories of the city.<END>

Fayth<NL>
They summoned all the buildings,<NL>
all the people who lived there.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
The people...<NL>
What, they're all dreams?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Me, too?<END>

Fayth<NL>
Yes, you're a<NL>
dream of the [fayth].<END>

Fayth<NL>
You, your father, your<NL>
mother, everyone. All dreams.<END>

Fayth<NL>
And if the [fayth] stop dreaming...<END>

<END>

<END>

<END>

<END>
