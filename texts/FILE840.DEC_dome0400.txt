[Rikku]<NL>
Someone's coming!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Lady [Yunalesca].<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Welcome to [Zanarkand].<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
I congratulate you, summoner.<NL>
You have completed your pilgrimage.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
I will now bestow you<NL>
with that which you seek.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
The Final Summoning...will be yours.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Now, choose.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
You must choose the<NL>
one whom I will change...<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
to become the fayth<NL>
of the Final Summoning.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
There must be a bond, between<NL>
chosen and summoner, for that is<NL>
what the Final Summoning embodies:<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
the bond between husband<NL>
and wife, mother and child,<NL>
or between friends.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
If that bond is strong enough,<NL>
its light will conquer [Sin].<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
A thousand years ago, I chose my<NL>
husband [Zaon] as my [fayth].<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Our bond was true, and I<NL>
obtained the Final Aeon.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
There is nothing to fear.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
You will soon be freed<NL>
of worry and pain.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
For once you call forth the<NL>
Final Aeon, your life will end.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Death is the ultimate<NL>
and final liberation.<END>

[Yunalesca]<NL>
Your father, [Braska],<NL>
chose this path.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It is not too late!<NL>
Let us turn back!<END>

[Braska]<NL>
If I turn back,<NL>
who will defeat [Sin]?<END>

[Braska]<NL>
Would you have some other summoner<NL>
and his guardians go through this?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
But...my lord, there<NL>
must be another way!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
This is the only way we got now!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Fine.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Make me the [fayth].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I been doing some thinking.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
My dream is back in<NL>
the other [Zanarkand].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I wanted to make that<NL>
runt into a star blitz player.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Show him the view<NL>
from the top, you know.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
But now I know there's<NL>
no way home for me.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I'm never going to see him again.<NL>
My dream's never gonna come true.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
So make me the [fayth].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I'll fight [Sin] with you, [Braska].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Then maybe my life will<NL>
have meaning, you know.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Don't do this, [Jecht]!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
If you live...<END>

[Auron]<NL>
there may be another way!<NL>
We'll think of something, I know!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Believe me, I thought this through.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Besides...<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I ain't gettin' any younger, so<NL>
I might as well make myself useful.<END>

[Braska]<NL>
[Jecht].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
What! You're not gonna<NL>
try to stop me, too?<END>

[Braska]<NL>
Sorry. I mean...thank you.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
[Braska] still has<NL>
to fight [Sin], [Auron].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Well, let's go.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Guard him well.<NL>
Make sure he gets there.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Lord [Braska]! [Jecht]!<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
What do you want now?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
[Sin] always comes back.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
It comes back after<NL>
the [Calm] every time!<END>

[Auron]<NL>
The cycle will continue and<NL>
your deaths will mean nothing!<END>

[Braska]<NL>
But there's always a chance<NL>
it won't come back this time.<END>

[Braska]<NL>
It's worth trying.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I understand what<NL>
you're saying, [Auron].<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
I'll find a way to break the cycle.<END>

<TEXT>
[Auron]<NL>
You have a plan?<END>

<TEXT>
[Braska]<NL>
[Jecht]?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
And the cycle went on.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We'll break it!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But how?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What, you got a plan now?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
If one of us has<NL>
to become a [fayth]...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I volunteer.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Me too, [Yuna]!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
If you want everything,<NL>
you'll end up with nothing.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But I want everything!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Now you're being childish!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
"You'll think of something"?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'll go ask [Yunalesca].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
She's got to know something.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You really think she'll help you?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I don't know, but I have to try.<END>

[Jecht]<NL>
Trust me, I'll think of something.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
That still won't change anything,<NL>
you know? You'd bring the Calm,<NL>
and then what?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
That won't break the cycle!<END>

<TEXT>
[Wakka]<NL>
Listen...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You wanna defeat [Sin]<NL>
and keep [Yuna] alive...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You don't want [Sin]<NL>
to come back, ya?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
That is just not gonna<NL>
happen, brudda, you know?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I give up.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So what would an adult do, then?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
They know they can just throw<NL>
away a summoner, then they<NL>
can do whatever they like.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You're right, I might<NL>
not even have a chance.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But no way am I gonna just<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
stand here and let [Yuna] go.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And what [Auron] said<NL>
about there being a way...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I think it's true.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
This is my story.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It'll go the way I want it...<NL>
or I'll end it here.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Wait.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You say it's your story,<NL>
but it's my story, too, you know?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
It would be so easy...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
to let my fate just carry me away...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
following this same path<NL>
my whole life through.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But I know...I can't.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
What I do, I do...<NL>
with no regrets.<END>

<END>
