<NL>
All hail Maester [Seymor]!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Brave [Crusader]s of [Spira],<NL>
protectors of all [Spira].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Believe in the path you have chosen,<NL>
let faith be your strength!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I, [Seymor] [Guado], maester of [Yevon2],<NL>
will bear witness to your deeds today.<END>

<TEXT>
<NL>
Sir!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
What's goin' on?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why's Maester [Seymor] backing<NL>
the [Crusader]s, eh?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
They're using the [Al Bhed]'s machina!<NL>
They're violating the teachings!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Even going against the teachings<NL>
they're willing to risk<NL>
it for the greater good.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Wakka, I think Maester<NL>
[Seymor] sees that, too.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Lulu]?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Hmm... I can only speculate.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Ask him yourself.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Ah, Sir [Auron]. It is an honor.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I would be most interested<NL>
in hearing what you've been<NL>
doing these past ten years.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I've got nothing to say about it.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
I...see.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Sir [Auron] must be a<NL>
great asset as a guardian.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Your Grace!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Please, there's no need for formalities.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Excuse me...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Maester [Seymor]?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why is your Lordship...<NL>
presently...present here...sir?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Please, speak as you normally would.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Isn't this operation against the teachings<NL>
of [Yevon2]? Aren't you gonna stop them?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
It's true... I should.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
However...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Both the [Crusader]s and the [Al Bhed]<NL>
truly wish peace for [Spira].<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
This [Operation Mi'ihen] was born<NL>
from that wish they share.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Although it may be sacrilege to<NL>
[Yevon2], their intentions are pure.<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
And I, [Seymor] [Guado]--<NL>
the person, not the maester of [Yevon2]...<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
As a denizen of [Spira],<NL>
I wish them well in their endeavor.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
But, using machina...<NL>
That's bad, isn't it?<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Pretend you didn't see them.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Beg your pardon, but that's not<NL>
something a maester should say!<END>

[Seymor]<NL>
Then, pretend I didn't say it.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You're kidding!<END>

<NL>
From the first time I laid eyes on him,<NL>
I never did like [Seymor]...<END>

<NL>
But you know, some of the things he said<NL>
that day... They made a lot of sense to me.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Excuse me, Lady Summoner [Yuna]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Yes?<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
The command center...<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Maester [Seymor] requests<NL>
your presence there, ma'am.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thank you.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Take that road to the<NL>
command center. It's not far.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
We're still in the midst of<NL>
preparations this way. Sorry.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
No, not this way, that way.<NL>
I guess I'm not good at explaining.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I'm just doing my job.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I know, I know.<NL>
I don't even make a good guide.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Much less a member of the<NL>
proud order of Chocobo Knights.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
Captain [Lucil] yells at me<NL>
all the time. I'm a disgrace.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I'm just a good-for-nothing.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Come on, don't say that!<NL>
Everyone's good at something!<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
No, no...<NL>
I deserve it anyway.<END>

<NL>
Here, this should come in handy.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s supplied us<NL>
with some goods. Here you go.<END>

<NL>
Here, take this, and try to<NL>
stay out of our way, okay?<END>

<NL>
You must take full precautions here.<NL>
Please use this if the need arises.<END>

<NL>
Stay alert during your trip.<NL>
I hope this helps.<END>

<NL>
We're sealing off this area for the<NL>
operation. All passage will be denied.<END>

<NL>
Maester [Seymor] got you in,<NL>
and now you wanna leave?<END>

<NL>
[Yevon2] did not forsake us after all.<NL>
Now we can fight without regret.<END>

<NL>
I've dispatched my men on patrol.<NL>
Fiends have infested the area.<END>

<NL>
[Master Seymor] came to witness our<NL>
deeds here today. We will destroy Sin,<NL>
even if it means our lives!<END>

<NL>
I must relay Lord [Seymor]'s message<NL>
to the men. This will be great for morale!<END>

<NL>
I guess we have [Yevon2]'s blessing, since<NL>
the maester himself wished us good fortune.<END>

<NL>
Who knows, Maester [Seymor] might<NL>
even summon aeons and fight alongside us.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Curse these...!<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
He really hates them, huh?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Chappu]...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
He left the sword [Wakka]<NL>
gave him in [Besaid].<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
And he fought with an [Al Bhed]<NL>
machina weapon instead.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
That's got nothing to do with it!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I just hate these<NL>
sacrilegious contraptions!<END>

<NL>
I will be the one to finish [Sin] off.<NL>
<END>

<NL>
We will use the ancient [machina]<NL>
to destroy [Sin].<END>

<NL>
The [Yevon2] fools will soon witness<NL>
the power of the [Al Bhed].<END>

<NL>
The cannon got out of place when we fired<NL>
a test shot. Packed too much powder, I guess.<END>

<NL>
I have to set her in<NL>
place before the operation.<END>

<NL>
Once [Sin] emerges from the sea,<NL>
we'll commence firing.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Our shots should stun it long enough<NL>
for the [Al Bhed] machina to finish it off.<END>

<NL>
We just fired a test shot,<NL>
and this puppy roars!<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It near knocked me out. Heck, it<NL>
probably echoed as far as [Luca]!<END>

<NL>
[Sin]'s gonna be a huge target.<NL>
We probably won't even have to aim.<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Welcome to [O'aka]'s! The operation's<NL>
only shop, open fer business!<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Good day, lad!<END>

[O'aka]<NL>
Sneaked past the guards, I did!<END>

[O'aka]<NL>

"[Operation Mi'ihen]" prices!<END>

The warrior monks and the [Guado2]<NL>
have joined forces to guard the Highroad.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Normally, it is the [Crusader]s' duty.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Maesters [Maester Kinoc] and [Seymor]<NL>
consider the people's safety above all.<END>

<NL>
The [Crusader]s have done their duty.<NL>
From now on, the warrior monks and<NL>
the [Guado] will protect [Spira].<END>

<NL>
I'm just a measly sentry now<NL>
that the [Crusader]s failed.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
Why do I have to suffer for<NL>
what those faithless morons did?<END>

<NL>
The [Guado2] are pretty brusque,<NL>
but they make reliable comrades.<END>

<NL>
Fiends are on the rampage!<NL>
Be on your guard.<END>

<NL>
After [Operation Mi'ihen], the<NL>
warrior monks took over the<NL>
Highroad guard duty.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
But now they've pulled out, saying<NL>
that they must protect [Bevelle].<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
It seems it's time that we<NL>
[Crusader]s resume our duty here.<END>
