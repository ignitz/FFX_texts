[Tidus]<NL>
Is that the [Djose] temple?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Awesome!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The Lightning Mushroom Rock. It only opens<NL>
when a summoner is addressing the [fayth].<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
That means another summoner's<NL>
already in there.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Another summoner?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What if it's [Dona]?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
We have to hurry.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Right! In we go!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
[Luzzu], he's...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Where is he?<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
I found him...but he was...<NL>
torn in half. I...<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
That...idiot!<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
What...what do I do now?<END>

[Gatta]<NL>
I can't do this...<NL>
I'm going back to [Besaid]!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Hey.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
[Gatta], he's...he's dead.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
He was a good fighter.<NL>
He just wasn't lucky enough.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
[Luzzu]!<NL>
Knock it off!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
You don't know what it's like!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I...do...know!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I'm sorry.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Why don't you...<NL>
go home now, to Besaid.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Take it easy a while.<NL>
Rest, ya?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Rest?<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
You need some R & R.<NL>
You're hurt, ya?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
I...I guess so.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Get better.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
I can't beat up on you when<NL>
you're all depressed, ya?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Right.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
Yo! Sleepyhead!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Sorry!<NL>
I'm so sorry!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Please forgive me.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Really, there's no rush...<NL>
Here, your hair.<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
A summoner with bed hair!<NL>
What's the world comin' to?<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You could have woken me up!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
We called to you, but<NL>
with all that snoring...<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
You too, Sir [Auron]?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Once Lady [Yuna]<NL>
fixes her hair, we leave!<END>

<NL>
I hadn't really laughed<NL>
like that in a long time.<END>

<NL>
It was only later that I realized...<END>

<NL>
The only one really<NL>
laughing then...was me.<END>

<NL>
Laughing must have been the<NL>
only thing keeping them going.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Why, it's you again.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You still on the road?<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Yes, but we're not<NL>
going to [Zanarkand].<END>

[Dona]<NL>
I've decided to go to<NL>
[Barthello]'s homeland.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
We are going to let the other<NL>
summoners deal with [Sin].<END>

[Dona]<NL>
I'm...I'm scared.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, don't worry about it.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
We'll put [Sin] in<NL>
his place in no time.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
You mean...the Final Summoning?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
No, we found another way<NL>
where no one has to die.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Well, whatever it is, good luck.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Cross your fingers.<END>

[Dona]<NL>
Do your best.<NL>
[Barthello], time to go.<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Mmm...what is it today?<NL>
Everyone's picking on me!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Ah, damn it! He was young!<NL>
He pushed his luck!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
What was he thinking--going up there<NL>
in the front lines like that?<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
He should've stayed back with command!<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
Damn it! Damn it all!<END>

[Wakka]<NL>
We're leavin' once [Yuna] gets here.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Dona] has left. [Isaaru], too.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
No matter how dark the night,<NL>
morning always comes.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
And our journey begins anew.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Get ready for the journey ahead.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
Will [Yevon2] forgive us?<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
The monks of [Djose] have kindly<NL>
offered to heal our wounded.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
[Yevon2] still looks<NL>
out for us... Even now.<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
I would pray for<NL>
those fallen in battle...<END>

[Lucil]<NL>
But how? How can I enter the<NL>
temple after what we have done?<END>

[Elma]<NL>
We won't defy [Yevon2].<NL>
Never again.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
This little fella's finally calmed down.<END>

[Elma]<NL>
The monks said we could<NL>
stay here for a while.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
No matter what we do next...<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
we're going to do it for<NL>
[Yevon2], that's for sure.<END>

[Clasko]<NL>
I've been thinking<NL>
about the future.<END>

[Luzzu]<NL>
This is all punishment<NL>
for turning from [Yevon2]...<END>

<NL>
Please leave the temple's safety to<NL>
the warrior monks, and enjoy some rest.<END>

<NL>
I quit the Crusaders and became a<NL>
warrior monk. So, what do you think?<END>

<NL>
Word is, those [Al Bhed] fools<NL>
are plotting something.<NEWPAGE>
<NL>
They're not pulling anything.<NL>
Not on our watch.<END>

<NL>
Lady [Yuna] is getting married!<NL>
What auspicious news!<END>
