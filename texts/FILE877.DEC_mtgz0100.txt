Summoner [Yuna]!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What is it this time?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
These mark the graves of summoners<NL>
and guardians who failed.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Summoners that die up here...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
aren't sent to the Farplane.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Why not?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Who would send them?<NL>
They die alone.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So that means...<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Many have become fiends, and they<NL>
may want [Yuna]'s company.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Well, [Yuna] will be fine.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You're right.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
All this way, only to fail.<NL>
It must have been tough.<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
Greetings, Lady [Yuna].<NL>
My name is [Wantz].<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Yuna]<NL>
We have met several<NL>
times before, right?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Not running today?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Wantz]<NL>
I have to carry on my<NL>
brother's business.<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
You've met him, I think.<NL>
[O'aka] XXIII, merchant extraordinaire?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Wait, you're that guy's brother?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Wantz]<NL>
My brother wanted to<NL>
come help Lady [Yuna].<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
But the temple imprisoned him<NL>
for helping traitors.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
They imprisoned him because of us?<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
He doesn't regret it, though.<NL>
In fact, he told me before<NL>
they took him...<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
"Don't worry about me,<NL>
just go help Lady [Yuna]."<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
But, why would your brother<NL>
do this for us?<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
Well...<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
Hey, this isn't the time for talking!<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
There's dealing to be done!<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
Welcome to [O'aka]'s!<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I will be sure to keep<NL>
your brother in my prayers.<END>

[Wantz]<NL>
He's doing the same<NL>
for you, Lady [Yuna].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
Thanks.<END>
