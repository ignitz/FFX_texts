[Lulu]<NL>
I hope that you're not<NL>
too mad at [Wakka].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Hey, not at all.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Thank you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Say, what do you think of [Rikku]?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Me?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
She's...fun to be with.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
That all?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Well, I can tell she's not a bad person.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Yeah.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You know what the problem is?<NL>
She's just another [Al Bhed] to [Wakka].<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Wakka]'s head is<NL>
as hard as a rock.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I bet it's because of [Yevon2].<NL>
Or, you know, something like that.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Well, there's more to it than that.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Wakka] doesn't like the [Al Bhed]<NL>
because of his brother [Chappu].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh...he used a <NL>
machina weapon, right?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
And got killed by [Sin].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Killed by my old man.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Damn you, [Jecht].<END>

<TEXT>
[Lulu]<NL>
What?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, nothing!<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Hey...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Can someone, like, a<NL>
human become [Sin] ever?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
I can't say that I know, but why?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Just a thought.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Sin] is the punishment for, and the<NL>
incarnation of, crimes we have committed.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So, no one really knows what it is?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
There's no need to know<NL>
so no one asks.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You run or you fight.<NL>
That is really all you can do.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
There's no sense brooding over it.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What, that's all?<NL>
I mean, you don't even wonder?<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You really do come from a world<NL>
where there is no [Sin], like you say.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Sorry about [Wakka].<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Rikku]<NL>
He didn't have to be so mean, ya?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I almost cried.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh...[Rikku]?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Just kidding!<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
It's okay.<NL>
At least you're still nice.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Hey, do I look like<NL>
[Yunie], you think?<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Well, my dad's sister is<NL>
[Yunie]'s mother, you get it?<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Oh...<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I had no idea!<NL>
If you say so.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Okay! I guess you're<NL>
guarding your family, then.<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
[Yuna]'s not the only one<NL>
that I want to protect.<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
We [Al Bhed] want to protect<NL>
all of the summoners, you know?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Summoners are...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
Well, you could say that...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
they sacrifice themselves to,<NL>
well...to bring happiness to [Spira].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What do you mean?<END>

<TEXT>
[Rikku]<NL>
Oh!<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
[Rikku]?<END>

<TEXT>
[Rikku]<NL>
Yes?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
"Sacrifice themselves"?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
You know, the pilgrimage...<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
It...uh...takes a lot out of you.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, right.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
But you know, [Yuna]'s real<NL>
serious about being a summoner.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
For [Yuna], well the pilgrimage<NL>
kinda means everything to her.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You are going to help her,<NL>
too, aren't you, [Rikku]?<END>

<TEXT>
[Rikku]<NL>
Um...   <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So you shouldn't say that<NL>
[Yuna]'s sacrificing herself.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
[Rikku]?<END>

[Rikku]<NL>
I hope you're right.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You're no fun to ride with at all.<END>

<TEXT>
[Auron]<NL>
What?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I'll take [Kimahri] over you any day!<END>

<TEXT>
[Auron]<NL>
Hmph.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Just don't do anything rash.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's that mean?<END>

[Auron]<NL>
I'm saying you should<NL>
not complicate matters.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Or you'll find yourself<NL>
trapped, understand?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I don't need you to tell me that!<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I guess there's some sense<NL>
in what you're saying.<END>

[Auron]<NL>
Make mistakes.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Auron]<NL>
That's what youth is for after all.<NL>
Do not waste it.<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
So which is it!?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Say...<END>

<NL>
          <END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What do you think about [Rikku]<NL>
being an [Al Bhed]?<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Ronso] are followers of [Yevon2].<NL>
[Ronso] dislike [Al Bhed].<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Oh, I get it.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
Not [Kimahri].<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Huh?<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Al Bhed] are [Al Bhed].<NL>
[Rikku] is [Rikku].<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Rikku] swore to protect [Yuna].<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
And [Rikku] is not a liar.<NL>
[Kimahri] can tell.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
So, she is a friend.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
You know, you might want<NL>
to tell her that later.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
I think she needs to know<NL>
that we still want her with us.<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] is surprised.<END>

<TEXT>
[Tidus]<NL>
Why?<END>

[Kimahri]<NL>
[Kimahri] think you are kind.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Uh, don't tell anyone, okay?<END>
