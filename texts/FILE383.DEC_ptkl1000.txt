[Tidus]<NL>
Uh, what's a "sending"?<NL>
Are we going somewhere?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You truly are clueless.<NL>
Are you sure it's just your<NL>
memory that's the problem?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The dead need guidance.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Filled with grief over<NL>
their own death, they<NL>
refuse to face their fate.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
They yearn to live on, and<NL>
resent those still alive.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You see, they envy the living.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
And in time, that envy<NL>
turns to anger, even hate.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Should these souls remain in<NL>
[Spira], they become fiends<NL>
that prey on the living.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Sad, isn't it?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
The sending takes them to<NL>
the [Farplane], where they<NL>
may rest in peace.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Summoners do this?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
It must be tough,<NL>
being a summoner.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
[Yuna] chose her own path. She knew<NL>
from the beginning what it meant.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
All we can do is protect<NL>
her along the way.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Until the end.<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
Until the...end?<END>

[Tidus]<NL>
What's the end?<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
Until she defeats [Sin].<END>

[Yuna]<NL>
I hope...<NL>
I hope I did okay.<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
You did very well!<END>

[Lulu]<NL>
They've reached the [Farplane] by now.<NL>
But...no tears next time, hm?<END>

<NL>
I wished there would<NL>
never be a next time.<END>

<NL>
No more people being killed by [Sin].<NL>
No more sendings for [Yuna].<END>

<NL>
Everyone stood there watching her.<END>

<NL>
It was strange, and somehow...horrifying.<END>

<NL>
I never wanted to see it again.<END>

<NL>
"Youth,<NL>
tread quietly upon the ground."<END>
